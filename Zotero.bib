	abstract = {High resolution electron microscopy (HREM) recently applied to phase decomposition and microstructure analyses was demonstrated for aluminium-based alloys such as the AlCu, AlMg and AlLi systems. The HREM has provided direct information on local structures on an atomic-scale resolution. In AlCu alloys, typical Guinier-Preston (GP) zones of type GP (1) and GP (2) with a single copper-rich layer and two copper-rich layers separated by three aluminium layers were clearly observed in the HREM images. The HREM images also revealed the coexistence of multiple-layer zones composed of several copper-rich layers. Lattice distortion around a single-layer GP (1) zone was not necessarily symmetric owing to the neighbouring-zone effect. A fine periodic structure similar to that of a GP (2) zone was found in rapidly solidified AlCu alloys. This structure was proposed to be closely connected with the multiple-layer GP zones. In AlMg alloys the supersaturated solid solution decomposed to form an initially modulated structure and subsequently spherical GP zones with the L12-type ordered structure. The periodic lattice distortion was introduced into the modulated structure associated with the magnesium atom fluctuation. Rapidly solidified AlMg alloys suggested the possibility that the homogeneous ordering process takes place. The uniformly ordered structure of the L12 type was more clearly detected in the AlLi alloys in the initial stage of decomposition. Both the interface and the morphology of this structure were quite different from those of the discrete δ′ phase. Thus the initial ordered structure was regarded as the precursor to the δ′ phase. The decomposition process was also discussed on the basis of experimentally obtained microstructures.},

Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and atom probe tomography (APT) were applied to characterize precipitates formed in the sensitized samples. Experimental results revealed that the size of Mg-rich precipitates increased with aging time at 70°C for both alloys. APT results showed that Mg-rich precipitates of different Mg concentrations and morphologies formed in Al matrix and on the interface of Al matrix/pre-existing particles. In addition, a model based on local equilibrium of chemical potential and multi-class precipitates number evolution was adopted to predict the multiphase precipitation process in the Al-Mg binary system. The overall trend of precipitate radius and number density predicted by the model matched well with the experimental results. Moreover, modeling results revealed that nucleation and coarsening occurred faster in Al 5083 H131 than in Al 5083 H116 when aged at same temperature. The high density of dislocations and the pipe diffusion mechanism of dislocations can be used to explain such behavior.},

	abstract = {The evolution of atomistic-level nanostructure during the early stages of both standard, high-temperature T6 heat treatment, and low-temperature secondary ageing after interruption of the former (T6I4), has been investigated in rapid hardening Al-Cu-Mg alloys using a variety of microscopy and microanalytical techniques, including transmission electron microscopy (TEM), positron annihilation spectroscopy (PAS) and atom probe tomography (APT). In order to carry out this objective, quantitative data-analysis methods were developed with respect to new cluster-finding algorithms, specifically designed for use with three-dimensional APT data.

Prior to this detailed characterisation work, the actual thermal impact from both heat treatment and quenching of small, lab-scale specimens was determined through correlation of both experimental results and calculations that modelled the heat transfer conditions using the lumped capacitance method. Subsequently, the maximum diffusion distance by random walk of the solute atoms was calculated for these periods, bearing significance on the propensity for these atoms to have the ability to cluster together, rather than segregate to the dislocation loops in the microstructure, which have a relatively larger interspacing distance.

Age-hardening curves for the Al-1.1Cu-xMg (x = 0, 0.2, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.7 at.\%) alloys at 150ºC show that the rapid hardening phenomenon (RHP) exists for Mg compositions ≥ 0.5Mg. Given that zone-like precipitate structures were unable to be detected by TEM or APT during the early stages of ageing at 150ºC, and that statistically significant dispersions of clusters were found in the APT data after ageing for 60 s, the RHP is attributed to these clustering reactions. Identification of clusters in the APT data has been achieved using the core-linkage algorithm and they have been found to be quite small, containing only a few atoms up to a couple of tens of atoms. The RHP is governed by some critical number density of both Mg clusters and Cu-Mg co-clusters of a critical size, whereas Cu clusters do not contribute significantly to the hardening mechanism. Significance testing indicates that Mg clusters are more significant at smaller clusters sizes and Cu-Mg co-clusters more important at larger cluster sizes.

Hardness results also confirm the existence of rapid early hardening during secondary ageing at 65ºC in Al-1.1Cu-1.7Mg. The mechanism of secondary rapid hardening involves a combination of both secondary clustering from solute (mainly Mg atoms) residual in solution, and pre-existing amorphous primary clusters that have slower growth kinetics at the lower secondary ageing temperature. The latter occurs mainly by vacancy-assisted diffusion of Mg atoms as evidenced by the gradual increase of the Mg:Cu ratio of co-clusters.

From an alloy design point of view it is important to fully understand the solute distribution in the microstructure to be able to subsequently optimise the configuration for enhanced material properties. The change in dispersion of solute atoms during ageing was determined by combining calculations of \% vacancy-solute associations with detailed measurements of the dislocation loops to estimate the solute distribution within the microstructure. The implication of the balance of solute atoms segregated to the loops compared with that in the matrix is then discussed in the context of hardnening mechanisms.},

The two S phases, denoted S1 and S2, form in competition with one another, with S1 being metastable with respect to S2. The lattice parameters of S2 are found to be in good agreement with those refined by Heying et al. (Z Naturforsch 2005;60B:491) for the equilibrium S phase. Despite the differences in their lattice parameters, both S1 and S2 appear to have the crystal structure proposed by Perlitz and Westgren (Ark Kemi Min Geol 1943;16B:1). The lattice parameters of both S1 and S2 are well defined, with little scatter between different samples treated for different times and temperatures, and there are no signs of the large range of lattice parameters reported by recent electron microscopy observations.},

	abstract = {In some alloy systems, e.g., Cu-Co, prior formation of clusters does not affect the nucleation of precipitates, whereas in others, e.g., Al-Cu-X, where X can be Mg, Ag, Cd, In, Sn, Si, or Ge (singly or in combination), clusters can not only accelerate the nucleation kinetics of the first phase to form but can also change the identity of this phase. When solute atoms in a cluster are strongly bound to one another but none has a high-binding energy to vacancies, clusters will tend to dissolve and to cease forming as a result of the loss of quenched-in vacancies before the incubation time for nucleation has elapsed unless the ambient vacancy concentration is high enough to sustain the clustering process. When solutes are also strongly bound to vacancies, however, clusters can survive through and beyond the incubation time. Two mechanisms are examined through which such clusters can assist nucleation. (a) One or more of the atom species constituting the clusters adsorbs at the interfaces of the nuclei and thereby reduces their interfacial energy. (b) At plate- (or lath-) shaped nuclei formed with an appreciable shear-strain energy, segregation of large atoms to the regions under tension within the local strain field and of small atoms and/or vacancies to local regions under compression can markedly reduce this strain energy. Nucleation taking place in the absence of static defects, such as aggregates, dislocations, internal boundaries, or particles, is clearly homogeneous when clusters do not assist the nucleation process. However, atom probe results have demonstrated the existence of clusters surviving long enough to assist nucleation and in so doing suggest that the definition of “heterogeneous nucleation” be extended to include even these continuously fluctuating heterogeneities.},

In addition, coincidence Doppler broadening of the positron–electron annihilation radiation was used to provide information about the chemical environment surrounding vacancy-like defects. The results obtained for the silver-free alloy indicate that, immediately after quenching from the solution treatment temperature, vacancy v-Cu–Mg clusters are formed in the supersaturated solid solution. During the early stages of ageing these clusters become richer in Cu and Mg and laths of the S phase (Al2CuMg) nucleate preferentially on dislocation lines. Continued ageing led to gradual precipitation of an equi-axed phase in the matrix between the S phase laths which is believed to be the cubic Z phase thought previously to form only if silver is present. For the silver-containing Al–Cu–Mg alloy, v-Cu–Mg–Ag aggregates also form immediately after quenching and the solute transport mechanisms are the same. However, precipitation of the S phase is suppressed during ageing and the silver addition promotes accelerated formation of a finer dispersion of smaller equi-axed Z phase precipitates. For both alloys, no evidence was found that the Z phase is preceded by any pre-precipitate or GP zones. Combination of coincidence Doppler broadening and microanalysis results revealed the Z phase to have a Mg:Cu ratio of 2 which indicates that it differs from the well known T phase (Al6CuMg4) which the equilibrium phase diagram indicates should form in Al–Cu–Mg alloys with high Mg:Cu ratios. Additional ageing experiments at 240°C showed that neither the Z phase or T phase are formed in the ternary alloy, but only precipitates of the S phase, while in the quaternary alloy the S phase is strongly suppressed and mainly Z phase precipitates are formed.},

	abstract = {Additions of a few tenths of a percent of Cu to Al–Mg alloys give rise to a noticeable age-hardening effect. This can be utilized to overcome the softening during paint curing of conventional Cu-free Al–Mg alloys of the AA 5xxx series for car body applications. In the present study we explore this effect in sheet material of the Al–Mg–Cu alloy AA 5023. Mechanical properties and formability of AA 5023 sheet were determined and compared with results obtained in the Cu-free alloys AA 5019 and AA 5182. The resistance to corrosion, viz. general pitting behaviour, filiform corrosion and, most notably, intergranular corrosion was probed. As to the latter, TEM analysis was performed to assess type, composition and spatial arrangement of grain boundary phases causing intergranular corrosion in AA 5xxx series alloys. The results are discussed as a function of alloy composition, recrystallized grain size as well as final heat treatment, i.e. batch annealing vs. continuous solution heat treatment.},

This work addresses the precipitation processes in the early stages by ab initio modeling of Guinier–Preston–Bagaryatsky (GPB) zone nucleation. We derive the structural nature of GPB zone nuclei and establish that the nucleation starts with 1D-GPB1 crystals, which represent thermodynamically stable configurations at the size scale previously associated only with solute clusters. It is also established that the 1D-GPB1 can form very rapidly due a simple structural transition from face-centered-cubic-based configurations (clusters). The formation of GPB zones in the early stages of aging is validated by comparison with previous experimental measurements. Based on previous experimental evidence, it is postulated that GPB zones rather than solute clusters may be able to rationalize the rapid hardening in the Al–Cu–Mg alloys.},

Pronounced cyclic hardening was observed in the under-aged states, and characterization of the microstructure using small-angle X-ray scattering illustrated that this was due to profuse dynamic precipitation at room temperature during cycling. Regardless of deformation conditions, the radius of the dynamically formed GP zones remained constant at 4–5Å, and only the volume fraction of the zones increased during cycling. The strain, strain rate and plastic strain amplitude dependence of the evolution of the volume fraction of zones forming dynamically was interpreted in terms of a nucleation-dominated reaction, and it is shown that the behaviour can be satisfactorily rationalized when the role of strain-induced vacancies is considered.},

These functions are generated in a highly efficient manner, thus allowing for the analysis of large data sets typical of APT. Experimental RDF calculations were performed for crystalline aluminium and a Mg65Cu25Y10 bulk metallic glass. For the pure aluminium sample, significant pair distance information was extracted, the quality of which was found to vary throughout the data set. Through a novel analysis procedure, the measured total RDF was used to map the local pair distance quality about each reconstructed atom. Surprisingly, the RDF quality maps indicated improved pair distance quality around poles and zone lines. In the case of the metallic glass, however, significant pair correlations were not discernible within the data set, despite short-range ordering being observed using TEM diffraction. The lack of correlations is thought to be associated with a non-uniform ion desorption sequence, as observed in this study. This affects the uniform evaporation assumption that is implicit in current 3D APT reconstruction procedures.},

The aim of this paper is to present a coupled approach able to describe precipitation and associated yield stresses for non-isothermal treatments of a 6061 aluminium alloy. The precipitation state (in terms of volume fraction and precipitate size distribution) is modelled thanks to a recent implementation of the classical nucleation and growth theories for needle-shaped precipitates. The precipitation model is validated through small-angle neutron scattering and transmission electron microscopy experiments. The precipitation size distribution is then used as an entry parameter of a micromechanical model for the yield strength of the alloy. Predicted yield stresses are compared to tensile tests performed with various heating conditions, representative of the heat-affected zone of a welded joint.},

This paper shows for the first time that, at around 200°C, there is coexistence of four different phases: (i) partially ordered nanometer-sized Mg-rich clusters of ellipsoidal shape, (ii) ordered GPB zones of one monolayer thickness, (iii) monoclinic semi-coherent S″ phase, and (iv) orthorhombic semi-coherent S′ which evolves into the incoherent equilibrium S phase of Al2CuMg. At room temperature, Mg-rich clusters precipitate before Cu–rich GPB zones. Clusters are considered to be precursors of the S′ phase, whereas GPB zones may transform into S″. New lattice parameters for S″ and S′ are proposed.},

	abstract = {In this study the artificial aging behavior of the Al–Mg–Si alloy AA 6061 was investigated in the temperature range 150–250 °C using atom probe tomography, hardness and resistivity measurements for various thermal histories. It was found that the precipitation kinetics and age-hardening response of artificial aging at temperatures below 210 °C are lowered by prior natural aging but enhanced above this temperature. An analysis of hardness data was used to evaluate the temperature dependence of precipitation kinetics and dissolution processes. Supported by theoretical considerations, it is assumed that artificial aging of Al–Mg–Si alloys is controlled via the concentration of mobile vacancies. The “vacancy-prison mechanism” proposed determines the mobile vacancy concentration in the case of natural pre-aging by temperature-dependent dissolution of co-clusters and solute–vacancy interactions.},

GPII zones are observed after aging at 438 K for 8 h, whereas higher aging temperatures, 463 K for 8 h and 533 K for 4 h, reveal only θ′ precipitates. Most GPII zones and θ′ precipitates are demonstrated to be Cu-deficient at the lower two aging temperatures; only the 533 K treatment resulted in θ′ stoichiometries consistent with the expected Al2Cu equilibrium composition. For alloys containing ∼200 at. ppm Si we find evidence of Si partitioning to GPII zones and θ′ precipitates. Significant Si segregation is observed at the coherent α-Al/θ′ interface for aging at 533 K, resulting in an interfacial Si concentration more than 11 times greater than in the α-Al matrix. Importantly, the Si interfacial concentration undergoes a transition from a non-equilibrium delocalized profile to an equilibrium localized profile as the aging temperature is increased from 463 to 533 K. Consistent with these measurements, first-principles calculations predict a strong thermodynamic driving force favoring Si partitioning to Cu sites in θ′. Silicon segregation at, and partitioning to, θ′ precipitates results in a decrease in interfacial free energy, and concomitantly an increase in the nucleation current. Our results suggest that Si catalyzes the early stages of precipitation in these alloys, consistent with the higher precipitate number densities observed in commercial Al–Cu–Si alloys.},

The evolution of microstructure was more complex than previously reported and involved processes common both to the binary Al–Cu and ternary Al–Cu–Mg systems. We report precipitation of a novel orientation of the common intermediate phase θ′, which we have designated θ II ′ . Isomorphous with the well-known body-centred tetragonal Al2Cu phase that occurs in Al–Cu-based alloys, we observed the following novel orientation: \{ 0 0 1 \} θ II ′ / / \{ 1 1 0 \} α , 〈 1 0 0 〉 θ II ′ / / 〈 0 0 1 〉 α . A trace of Mg was associated with the θ II ′ orientation and we suggest that this is a consequence of the role that Mg atom clusters play during nucleation. For the first time, we also report the occurrence of the σ phase (Al5Cu6Mg2) in a new orientation analogous to that of θ II ′ , designated as σ II: \{ 0 0 1 \} α / / \{ 0 0 1 \} σ II and 〈 1 1 0 〉 α / / 〈 0 1 0 〉 σ II . These results are discussed in terms of microstructural design for age hardening in Al–Cu–Mg base alloys, much of which involves the θ′ and σ precipitate phases.},

For Al–0.1Zr, precipitation of Al3Zr (L12) initiates between 350 and 375 °C, resulting in a 420 MPa peak microhardness at 425–450 °C. A pronounced synergistic effect is observed when both Sc and Zr are present. Above 325 °C, Zr additions provide a secondary strength increase from the precipitation of Zr-enriched outer shells onto the Al3Sc precipitates, leading to a peak microhardness of 780 MPa at 400 °C for Al–0.1Sc–0.1Zr. Compositions, radii, volume fractions and number densities of the Al3(Sc1−xZrx) precipitates are measured directly using atom-probe tomography.

The present HRTEM and HAADF-STEM observations revealed that a quenched cluster is a monolayer Cu-rich plate approximately a few nm Cu in size, G.P.(I) is also a monolayer copper platelet but slightly larger than the cluster. G.P.(II) is bilayer and θʺ comprises multiple (at least three) copper-layers, respectively. The Vickers microhardness increased mainly due to the formation of quenched clusters and G.P.(II).},

It also enables scattering data from different instruments (light, X-ray, or neutron scattering) to be combined, and it can even be useful to detect the existence of artifacts in the experimental data. Different primary or secondary calibration methods are available. In the latter case, absolute intensity calibration requires a stable artifact with the necessary scattering profile. Glassy carbon has sometimes been selected as this intensity calibration standard. Here we review the spatial homogeneity and temporal stability of one type of commercially available glassy carbon that is being used as an intensity calibration standard at a number of SAS facilities. We demonstrate that glassy carbon is sufficiently homogeneous and stable during routine use to be relied upon as a suitable standard for absolute intensity calibration of SAS data.},

	abstract = {This paper examines the extraction of structural information in the form of Radial Distribution Functions (RDFs) using Atom Probe Tomography (APT) data. These functions are generated in a highly efficient manner, thus allowing for the analysis of large data sets typical of APT. Experimental RDF calculations were performed for crystalline aluminium and a Mg65Cu25Y10 bulk metallic glass. For the pure aluminium sample, significant pair distance information was extracted, the quality of which was found to vary throughout the data set. Through a novel analysis procedure, the measured total RDF was used to map the local pair distance quality about each reconstructed atom. Surprisingly, the RDF quality maps indicated improved pair distance quality around poles and zone lines. In the case of the metallic glass, however, significant pair correlations were not discernible within the data set, despite short-range ordering being observed using TEM diffraction. The lack of correlations is thought to be associated with a non-uniform ion desorption sequence, as observed in this study. This affects the uniform evaporation assumption that is implicit in current 3D APT reconstruction procedures.},

SAXS, with its high-field-of-view and resultant large statistics, perfectly complements TEM and APT at the nanometer length-scale. The combined results provide a comprehensive description of the evolution of the fine precipitates. W319 exhibits two types of fine coherent precipitates on aging namely, θ′ and Q, whose temporal evolution has been studied using time-resolved in situ SAXS analyses at three different aging temperatures: 438, 463, and 533 K. Complementary information about the morphology, dimensions and number density of the precipitates were determined from ex situ APT and TEM analyses. Coherent precipitates from a single grain of the α-Al-matrix of W319 give rise to an anisotropic SAXS signal, which is subsequently simulated, taking into account the relative orientation of the sample and the crystallographic orientation relationships of the different precipitates. The simulated anisotropic SAXS intensity, based on the results from APT and TEM, is validated utilizing the experimentally obtained 2D SAXS patterns. This permits us to determine the dimensions and number densities of the precipitates from anisotropic SAXS signals, and a complete quantitative analysis of the in situ temporal evolution of the coherent precipitates is performed. Additionally, the present study demonstrates an alternative technique for extracting structural parameters from anisotropic SAXS analyses. The methodology presented herein will be useful for age-hardening analyses of commercial age-hardenable Al-based alloys and Ni-based super alloys.},

Increasing the pre-strain level, to the maximum obtainable before plastic instability (15\%), resulted in an increase in the T8 yield strength to ∼ 670 MPa with a corresponding reduction in ductility from ∼11 to 7.5\%. Microstructure data have been used to deconvolute and model the effects of increasing pre-strain on the main strengthening components that contribute to this large strength increase. The precipitation strengthening model proposed by Dorin et al. [1] has been successfully employed to calculate the strengthening contribution of the T1 phase and the increase in strength due to strain hardening has been modelled using X-ray line broadening measurements of dislocation density, using the modified Williamson–Hall approach. Refinement of the T1 phase was observed to continue to higher pre-strains than previously thought, but it is predicted that this leads to a reduction in the strengthening contribution from precipitation. In contrast a low level of recovery was observed during stretching, and artificial ageing, resulting in an increasing contribution form strain hardening with pre-strain. Thus, it is shown that increasing the pre-strain prior to ageing results in a reduction in the strengthening provided by the T1 phase, in favour of an increase in the strain hardening contribution.},

	abstract = {A review is presented of the relaxation phenomena due to the intrinsic properties of dislocations. The Bordoni peaks of internal friction were first observed in f.c.c. metals. Their essential features (primary and secondary characteristics) have been deduced from the ensemble of experimental results in the literature. The stability of these peaks during annealing after cold work strongly suggests that the Bordoni relaxation is linked to the intrinsic properties of dislocations. Thus, we present the principal theoretical models proposed to explain intrinsic dislocation relaxations. There are: the relaxation models based upon the thermally-activated generation of double-links, models based upon the migration of dislocation dipoles and jogs. A detailed comparison of the predictions of these models with the published experimental results leads us to the conclusion that the double-kink relaxation model is the most suitable. The experimental results obtained on deformed h.c.p. and b.c.c. metals, ionic and covalent crystal-line materials are also reviewed. In these materials there are many relaxation phenomena attributed to dislocations, and there is a good deal of variability in the results reported from one laboratory to another. A coherent picture appears to be emerging in the case of h.c.p. and b.c.c. metals; but at present, it is difficult to attribute a precise mechanism to each internal friction peak. In addition, studies are reviewed of microplasticity in the temperature range of the Bordoni relaxation. A correlation between the mechanisms of microplasticity and internal friction is demonstrated. This analysis yields an estimate of the Peierls stress in f.c.c. metals of about 10−4 μ.},

During tensile loading the dislocation density evolution was documented from the as-received material (initial micro-strain state) to the relaxation of the strains during elastic deformation. After yield, the increasing rate of dislocation density growth was relatively fast till half-way between yield and UTS. After that, the rate started to decrease and the dislocation density fluctuated as the elongation increased due to the generation and annihilation of dislocations. When dislocation generation is dominant, the correlation between the flow stress and dislocation density satisfies the Taylor equation.

In this temperature range precise activation volume measurements on [001 ]aluminum crystals show that the Cottrell-Stokes relation is observed at low stresses, but deviation from it is prominent at high stresses. This deviation is attributed to the plastic generation of defects which are more rate sensitive than monopole dislocations but contribute little to the flow stress. In the high stress region for both single crystals and polycrystalline material, the flow stress normalized with respect to modulus and temperature can be correlated to the activation volume and in turn to the familiar power law form with respect to strain rate.},

This excellent combination of tensile mechanical properties was shown to be a result of complex dynamic strain-induced microstructural reactions, including dislocation glide, dislocation dissociation, stacking fault formation, dynamic recovery, mechanical twinning and dynamic strain ageing. The contribution of each of these processes was discussed with respect to the strain hardening behaviour. An important observation was that the propensity for mechanical twinning in a particular grain strongly depends on its crystallographic orientation and is clearly correlated with the magnitude of the corresponding Taylor factor. The current results reveal that the development of partial dislocations and stacking faults at an early stage of straining and the consequent interaction of gliding dislocations with stacking fault interfaces enhances the strain hardening rate. Subsequent or concurrent initiation of mechanical twins also contributes to strain hardening through a dynamic Hall–Petch effect limiting the dislocation mean free path and consequently enhancing dislocation storage. Dynamic strain ageing (DSA) took place at a late stage of deformation, adding to strain hardening. DSA is a factor reducing ductility by promoting strain localization.},

The intrinsic stability of plastic deformation on the local scale has been examined with the help of standard methods of nonlinear analysis.

The stress equivalence holds throughout the onset of deformation up to failure where the corresponding relationships are: V ∗ ∼ σ F - 0.68 and V ∗ ∼ σ F - 0.5 . The differences are attributed to the refinement of dislocation debris dominating down-rate change responses. An apparent activation volume equivalence of the work hardening is observed over the broad range of activation volumes, suggesting correspondence between thermally activated glide of dislocations over the obstacles and defect storage capacity of alloys.

The rate and temperature-dependence of the deformation can be understood on the basis of the mobility of Mg atoms. When the Mg atoms can diffuse at a sufficient rate they interact with dislocations to produce serrated yielding and a zero or negative strain rate sensitivity. This greatly restricts the tensile ductility. Outside of this serrated flow regime enhanced ductilities are achieved due to the positive strain rate sensitivity stabilizing any inhomogeneities which develop. However, the final fracture is also influenced by the constituent particle concentration. Voiding occurs at particles and if the concentration of particles is sufficiently large the voids link up by local shear. Decreasing the constituent particle concentration, together with a reduction in the amplitude of serrations, results in larger tensile ductilities. At high temperatures, quite large strain rate sensitivities can be achieved but the ductility is finally limited by the propensity for voiding in these alloys.},

	abstract = {A model is proposed for the critical strains associated with the Portevin-Le Châtelier effect (PLC) in terms of the strain dependence of the densities of mobile and forest dislocations. The classical critical condition for the onset of the PLC effect, viz. that of vanishing of the strain rate sensitivity of flow stress under the influence of dynamic strain aging is reexamined. The analysis takes into account the strain dependence of a key quantity: the elementary strain produced when all mobile dislocations perform a successful thermally activated step through the forest obstacles. This elementary strain is estimated by studying a system of coupled differential equations for the evolution of the two densities. Results are obtained in semi-quantitative form and compared with available data. It is shown that the following effects are consistently explained: the occurrence of critical strains for the onset and termination of jerky flow, occasional observation of two PLC regimes within the same deformation curve, the behaviour of the critical strains at high strain rates and low temperatures and, possibly, the particular behaviour exhibited by some alloys at low strain rates and high temperatures. Consequences for the “friction” and “forest” models of dynamic strain aging are discussed. Un modéle tenant compte de la variation avec la déformation des densités de dislocations mobiles et de la forêt est proposé pour les déformations critiques associées à l'effett Portevin-Le Châtelier (PLC). La condition critique classique pour l'application de l'effet PLC suivant laquelle la sensibilité à la vitesse de la contrainte d'écoulement s'annule sous l'effet du vieillissement dynamique est réexaminée. L'analyse est effectuée en fonction d'une quantité essentielle: la déformation élémentaire obtenue lorsque toutes les dislocations mobiles, effectuent un mouvement thermiquement acitivé à travers les obstacles de la forêt. Cette déformation élémentaire et sa dépendence en déformation sont calculées au moyen d'un système d'équations différentielles couplées pour lévolution des deux densités. Les résultats obtenus sous forme semi-quantitative sont comparés avec les données de la littérature. Les effects suivants peuvent alors être expliqués: l'existence de déformations critiques pour l'apparition et la disparition de la déformation instable, l'observation occasionnelle de deux régimes successifs d'effet PLC sur une même courbe de déformation, lévolution des déformations critiques à forte vitesse de déformation et à basse température, peut-être également le comportement particulier de certains alliages à faible vitesse et à haute température. Les conséquences concernant les modéles de “friction” et de “forêt” du vieillissement dynamique sont discutées. Es wird ein Modell zur Beschreibung der kritischen Dehnungen vorgestellt, die für den Portevin-Le Châtelieer-Effekt (PLC) charakteristisch sind. Dem Modell liegt die Dehnungs-abhängigkeit der Dichten von beweglichen und Waldversetzungen zugrunde. Die klassische kritische Bedingung für das Einssetzen des PLC-Effektes, die darin besteht, daβ die Geschwindigkeitsempfindlichkeit der Flieβspannung als Folge dynamischer Reckalterung gleich Null wird, wird überprüft. Hierbei wird der Analyse der Dehnungsabhängigkeit der Elementardehnung eine Schlüsselrolle beigemessen. Diese Gröβe wird als Dehnungsinkrement definiert, der durch einen thermisch aktivierten Schritt aller beweglichen Versetzungen im Hindernisfeld der Waldversetrzungen erzeugt wird. Diese Elementardehnung wird abgeschätz, indem ein Differentialgleichungssystem fü die beiden gekoppelten Versetzungsdichten untersucht wird. Die Ergebnisse sind in halbquantitativer Form präsentiert. Sie werden mit vorhandenen Meβdaten verglichen. Es wird gezeigt, daβ folgende Effekte schlüssig erklärt werden können: das Aufreten der kritischen Dehnungen, bei denen diskontinuierliches plastisches Flieβen einsetzt bzw. aufhört; vereinzelte Beobachtungen des Auftretens zweier PLC-Bereiche innerhalb einer und derselben Verformungskurve; das Verhalten der kritischen Dehnungen bei hohen Dehngeschwindigkeiten und niedrigen Temperaturen und—in bestimmten Legierungen—bei niedrigen Dehngeschwindigkeiten und hohen Temperaturen. Die Auswirkungen des Modells für das “Reibungs”-bzw. “Waldmodell” der dynamischen Reckalterung werden diskutiert.},

	abstract = {A theoretical model is presented for hot working when dynamical recrystallization occurs. The workhardening and recovery of the dislocation structure as well as the recrystallization and the continuous grain growth are taken into account. The model is based on a description of the volume distributions of dislocations, which are produced as a result of the continuous recrystallization. Stress-strain curves are computed for iron and nickel and compared with experimental results of Luton and Sellars, and of Glover and Sellars. The model reproduces a number of features in the experimental curves as, for example, the flow stress oscillations at low strain rates, the distinct peak stress at high strain rates, the strain rate dependence of the peak stress and of the steady state stress, the strain rate dependence of the recrystalized grain size. The model suggests that the distinct peak stress at high strain rates is largely an effect of the variation in grain size during the dynamical recrystallization. On présente un modèle de la déformation à chaud lorsqu'il se produit une recristallisation dynamique. On tient compte de 1 écrouissage et de la restauration de la structure de dislocations, ainsi que de la recristallisation et de la croissance continue des grains. Le modèle repose sur une description de la répartition en volume des dislocations produites par la recristallisation continue. On compare les courbes contrainte-déformation calculées pour le nickel et le fer avec les résultats expérimentaux de Luton et Sellars, et de Glover et Sellars. Le modèle rend compte d'un certain nombre de caractéristiques des courbes expérimentales comme, par exemple, les oscillations de la contrainte de fluage aux faibles vitesses de déformation, le pic de contrainte distinct aux fortes vitesses de déformation, et l'influence de la vitesse de déformation sur le pic de contrainte, sur la contrainte en régime permanent et sur la taille des grains recristallisés. Le modèle suggère que le pic de contrainte, distinct aux fortes vitesses de déformation, provient en grande partie de la variation de la taille des grains au cours de la recristallisation dynamique. Es wird ein theoretisches Modell für die Warmverformung mit dynamischer Rekristallisation vorgesehlagen. Sowohl die Verfestigung und Erholung der Versetzungsstruktur als auch die Rekristallisation und das kontinuierliche Kornwachstum werden berücksichtigt. Das Modell basiert auf einer Beschreibung der räumlichen Verteilung der als Folge der kontinuierlichen Rekristallisation erzeugten Versetzungen. Verfestigungskurven werden für Eisen und Nickel berechnet und mit experimentellen Ergebnissen von Luton und Sellars und von Glover und Sellars verglichen. Das Modell liefert eine Reihe von Eigenschaften der experimentellen Kurven, wie, z.B. Flieβspannungsoszillationen bei kleinen Abgleitgeschwindigkeiten, die ausgeprägte Peak-Spannung bei groβen Abgleitgeschwindigkeiten, die Abhängigkeit der Peak-Spannung, der stationären Spannung und der rekristallisierten Korngröβe von der Abgleitgeschwindigkeit. Das Modell deutet darauf hin, daβ die Peak-Spannung bei hohen Abgleitgeschwindigkeiten hauptsächlich die Folge der während der dynamischen Rekristallisation variablen Korngröβe ist.},

	abstract = {Local strain hardening in a cross-section of a deforming crystal has been related to the evolutionary behavior of the coupled densities of the mobile and (relatively immobile) forest dislocations. The local mechanical properties thus calculated differ from the bulk properties as obtained by the application of the Orowan relation on the bulk scale or by measuring the overall strain hardening in a macroscopic specimen. This difference is especially pronounced at small strains, and it is attributed to the inherently nonuniform character of plastic deformation by slip. The intrinsic stability of plastic deformation on the local scale has been examined with the help of standard methods of nonlinear analysis. In addition to such nonuniformities as yield points and the occurrence of necking (Considère instability), slip lines and slip bands also appear to be interprétable in terms of local instability of plastic flow. Le durcissement d'écrouissage d'un cristal en cours de déformation plastique est évalué à l'échelle locale d'une section de l'échantillon en fonction de l'évolution couplée de deux densités de dislocations: les dislocations mobiles et les dislocations de la forêt, relativement immobiles. Les propriétés mécaniques locales ainsi calculées diffèrent de celles prévues par l'application de la loi d'Orowan au matériau massif et des résultats expérimentaux obtenus sur échantillons macroscopiques. Cette différence, particulièrement marquée aux faibles déformations, est attribuée au caractère nonuniforme que présente systématiquement la déformation plastique par glissement. La stabilité intrinsèque de la déformation plastique est examinée à l'échelle locale à l'aide des méthodes courantes pour l'étude des systèmes non linéaires. Outre les phénomènes classiques tels que crochets de traction ou instabilité de Considère (striction), les lignes et bandes de glissement semblent également devoir être interprétées en termes d'une instabilité locale de l'écoulement plastique. Die lokale Verfestigung bei der Verformung in einem Kristallquerschnitt wurde mit dem Evolutionsverhalten zweier gekoppelter Versetzungsdichten in Verbindung gebracht: der Dichte von bewegten Versetzungen und der von (relativ unbewegten) Waldversetzungen. Die so berechneten lokalen mechanischen Eigenschaften unterscheiden sich von den makroskopischen Eigenschaften, wie sie durch Messungen an einer massiven Probe oder durch die Anwendung der Orowanschen Beziehung auf die gesamte Probe ermittelt werden. Diese Unterschiede, die besonders stark bei kleinen Dehnungen ausgeprägt sind, werden als Folge einer stets vorhandenen Ungleichmäβigkeit der plastischen Verformung mittels Gleitung angesehen. Die intrinsische Stabilität der lokalen plastischen Verformung wurde mit Hilfe von Standardmethoden der nichtlinearen Analysis untersucht. Auβer solchen Ungleichmäβigkeiten wie Streckgrenzen und Einschnürungen (Considère-Instabilität), scheinen auch Gleitlinien und Gleitbänder in den Kategorien der lokalen Instabilität interpretierbar zu sein.},

As test-cases, the DDD is used to study the activation of Bardeen–Herring sources upon the application of an external stress or under vacancy supersaturation.

Besides an increase in the yield strength, the fine-grained material exhibited an inflection in the stress–strain curve after initial yield. Static and dynamic TEM studies revealed that the annealing twin boundaries acted as sources of perfect dislocations, partial dislocations and deformation twins; as barriers to the propagation of these dislocations; and as annihilation sites for dislocations. With increasing strain and as the twin boundaries were penetrated by dislocations, they contributed less to the overall mechanical properties. Based on these observations, equations for the evolution of mobile and forest dislocation densities are posed, depicting boundary sources and dislocation–dislocation interactions, respectively. The deformation response is modeled by computing the aggregate response of matrix–twin composite grains in the viscoplastic self-consistent scheme, which permits consideration of compatibility and equilibrium requirements across the twin boundaries. This work highlights the significant role boundaries play in generating the dislocations that control the macroscopic mechanical response.},

It is shown that the following effects are consistently explained: the occurrence of critical strains for the onset and termination of jerky flow, occasional observation of two PLC regimes within the same deformation curve, the behaviour of the critical strains at high strain rates and low temperatures and, possibly, the particular behaviour exhibited by some alloys at low strain rates and high temperatures. Consequences for the “friction” and “forest” models of dynamic strain aging are discussed. Un modéle tenant compte de la variation avec la déformation des densités de dislocations mobiles et de la forêt est proposé pour les déformations critiques associées à l'effett Portevin-Le Châtelier (PLC). La condition critique classique pour l'application de l'effet PLC suivant laquelle la sensibilité à la vitesse de la contrainte d'écoulement s'annule sous l'effet du vieillissement dynamique est réexaminée. L'analyse est effectuée en fonction d'une quantité essentielle: la déformation élémentaire obtenue lorsque toutes les dislocations mobiles, effectuent un mouvement thermiquement acitivé à travers les obstacles de la forêt. Cette déformation élémentaire et sa dépendence en déformation sont calculées au moyen d'un système d'équations différentielles couplées pour lévolution des deux densités. Les résultats obtenus sous forme semi-quantitative sont comparés avec les données de la littérature. Les effects suivants peuvent alors être expliqués: l'existence de déformations critiques pour l'apparition et la disparition de la déformation instable, l'observation occasionnelle de deux régimes successifs d'effet PLC sur une même courbe de déformation, lévolution des déformations critiques à forte vitesse de déformation et à basse température, peut-être également le comportement particulier de certains alliages à faible vitesse et à haute température. Les conséquences concernant les modéles de “friction” et de “forêt” du vieillissement dynamique sont discutées. Es wird ein Modell zur Beschreibung der kritischen Dehnungen vorgestellt, die für den Portevin-Le Châtelieer-Effekt (PLC) charakteristisch sind. Dem Modell liegt die Dehnungs-abhängigkeit der Dichten von beweglichen und Waldversetzungen zugrunde. Die klassische kritische Bedingung für das Einssetzen des PLC-Effektes, die darin besteht, daβ die Geschwindigkeitsempfindlichkeit der Flieβspannung als Folge dynamischer Reckalterung gleich Null wird, wird überprüft. Hierbei wird der Analyse der Dehnungsabhängigkeit der Elementardehnung eine Schlüsselrolle beigemessen. Diese Gröβe wird als Dehnungsinkrement definiert, der durch einen thermisch aktivierten Schritt aller beweglichen Versetzungen im Hindernisfeld der Waldversetrzungen erzeugt wird. Diese Elementardehnung wird abgeschätz, indem ein Differentialgleichungssystem fü die beiden gekoppelten Versetzungsdichten untersucht wird. Die Ergebnisse sind in halbquantitativer Form präsentiert. Sie werden mit vorhandenen Meβdaten verglichen. Es wird gezeigt, daβ folgende Effekte schlüssig erklärt werden können: das Aufreten der kritischen Dehnungen, bei denen diskontinuierliches plastisches Flieβen einsetzt bzw. aufhört; vereinzelte Beobachtungen des Auftretens zweier PLC-Bereiche innerhalb einer und derselben Verformungskurve; das Verhalten der kritischen Dehnungen bei hohen Dehngeschwindigkeiten und niedrigen Temperaturen und—in bestimmten Legierungen—bei niedrigen Dehngeschwindigkeiten und hohen Temperaturen. Die Auswirkungen des Modells für das “Reibungs”-bzw. “Waldmodell” der dynamischen Reckalterung werden diskutiert.},

The analysis includes both isothermal and non-isothermal transformation behaviour. Well established dislocation theory is then used to evaluate the resulting change in hardness or yield strength at room temperature, based on a consideration of the intrinsic resistance to dislocation motion due to solute atoms and particles, respectively following heat treatment. The model is validated by comparison with experimental microstructure data obtained from transmission electron microscope examinations and hardness measurements, covering a broad range in the experimental conditions. It is concluded that the model is sufficiently relevant and comprehensive to be used as a tool for predicting the response of Al–Mg–Si alloys to thermal processing, and some examples are given towards the end.},

During artificial aging, significant changes in the work-hardening rate were observed as the precipitation reaction proceeded. A semiempirical model has been developed to interpret these changes in work-hardening rate. This model shows that the significant changes in work-hardening rate can be related to the manner in which flow stress contributions from different obstacles are summed and the transition from shearable to nonshearable precipitates. The present study presents a new approach to determining the shearable/nonshearable transition from a series of tensile tests. Results on the aluminum alloy AA7030 were also found to be consistent with the proposed theoretical framework. Finally, the proposed model allows the overall mechanical response for a variety of aging conditions to be rationalized.},

	abstract = {The ageing process of AlZnMg alloys after quenching and after cold-work at −196°C has been studied by resistivity measurements. The Mg content markedly increases the supersaturation of the alloy, hence the density and stability of G.P. zones. The activation energy controlling the ageing kinetics resulted in a value of 0.67 eV independently of Mg concentration. The plastic deformation does not change the ageing characteristics of the alloys, but affects its kinetics, slowing down the rate process when G.P. zones are the prevailing phase, i.e. at low temperatures, and enhancing the rate when semicoherent or incoherent phases precipitate, i.e. at high temperature. Der Alterungsprozeß wurde in AlZnMg-Legierungen nach Abschrecken und Kaltverformung bei −196°C mit Hilfe von Widerstandsmessungen untersucht. Zunehmender Mg-Anteil erhöht die Übersättigung beträchtlich und somit auch die Dichte und Stabilität der GP-Zonen. Die Aktivierungsenergie der Alterungskinetik ergab sich unabhängig von der Mg-Konzentration zu 0,67 eV. Die plastische Verformung ändert das Alterungsverhalten der Legierungen nicht; sie beeinflußt jedoch die Kinetik, indem sie den Prozeß verlangsamt, wenn die GP-Zonen die vorherrschende Phase sind (d.h. bei tiefen Temperaturen) und ihn beschleunigt, wenn sich semikohärente oder inkohärente Phasen ausscheiden (d.h. bei hohen Temperaturen). Le phénomène de vieillissement après trempe, et après écrouissage à −196°C, a été étudié dans des alliages AlZnMg au moyen de mesures de résistivité. La présence de quantités croissantes de magnésium augmente notablement la sursaturation de l'alliage et, de ce fait, la densité et la stabilité des zones est de 0,67 eV quelle que soit la teneur en magnésium. La déformation plastique ne modifie pas les caractéristiques du vieillissement des alliages, mais en modifie la cinétique. Le processus activé est ralenti dans le domaine où les zones G.P. constituent la phase prédominante, c'est-à-dire à basse température. Le vieillissement est par contre accéléré dans les conditions où les phases semi-cohérentes ou incohérentes précipitent, c'est-à-dire à haute température.},

	abstract = {A resistometric investigation of the influence of a small addition of Mg (0.1\%) on the features of the pre-precipitation phenomenon in the Al-Zn 10\% alloy has been carried out following the same experimental scheme employed in a previous research on the binary alloy. The results have shown that whereas the influence of Mg on the general pattern of pre-precipitation is negligible, all the kinetic behaviour of the process in radically changed by the presence of Mg, as the dependence on quenching and aging temperatures and the tune of complete reaction. The results have been interpreted in a very consistent way based on the following points: 1.(1) a strong binding energy exists between Mg atoms and vacancies in the ternary alloy so that all vacancies are coupled to Mg atoms;2.(2) Mg-vacancy couples can move easily at room temperature so that diffusion of Zn atoms in the ternary alloy occurs via Mg-vacancy couples. The value of the binding energy results 0.54 ± 0.08 eV although a slightly lower value may also be consistent with the above interpretation. Les auteurs ont étudié par résistométrie l'influence d'une petite addition de Mg (0,1\%) sur l'allure du phénomène de pré-précipitation dans l'alliage Al-Zn 10\%, en employant le schéma expérimental déjà utilisé dans une étude antérieure sur l'alliage binaire. Bien que l'influence de Mg sur l'allure générale de la pré-précipitation soit négligeable, la cinétique du processus est radicalement modifiée par la présence de Mg, de même que la manière dont la réaction dépend des températures de trempe et de vieillissement, et la durée de la réaction complète. Les résultats peuvent s'interpréter de manière très satisfaisante en admettant: 1.(1) qu'il existe dans l'alliage ternaire une forte énergie de liaison entre les atomes Mg et les lacunes, de sorte quec toutes les lacunes sont couplées à des atomes Mg;2.(2) que les couples Mg-lacune peuvent se déplacer facilement à la température ambiante, de sorte que la diffusion des atomes de zinc se produit, dans l'alliage ternaire, par l'intermédiaire des couples Mg-lacune. L'énergie de liaison est évaluée à 0,54 ± 0,008 eV, mais une valeur un peu inférieure serait également compatible avec l'interprétation ci-dessus. Eine auf Widerstandsmessung beruhende Untersuchung des Einflusses einer kleinen Beimischung von Mg (0,1\%) auf die Kennzeichen der Vorausscheidung in einer Al-Zn 10\% Legierung wurde ausgeführt. Sie folgt dem gleichen experimentellen Schema, das bei einer vorhergehenden Untersuchung der binären Legierung verwendet wurde. Die Ergebnisse haben gezeigt, dass, während der Einfluss von Magnesium auf das allgemeine Muster einer Vorausscheidung vernachlässigbar ist, das kinetische Verhalten der Reaktion durch die Gegenwart von Mg radikal geändert wird, wie z.B. die Abhängigkeit von Abschreck-und Auslagerungstemperaturen un die Zeit bis zum vollständigen Ablauf der Reaktion. Die Ergebnisse werden in sehr geschlossener Weise an Hand der folgenden Punkte gedeutet: 1.(1) Es existiert eine starke Bindungsenergie zwischen Mg-Atomen und Leerstellen in der ternären Legierung, so dass alle Leerstellen mit Mg-Atomen gekoppelt sind.2.(2) Mg-Leerstellen-Paare können sich bei Raumtemperatur leicht bewegen, sodass eine Diffusion von Zn-Atomen in der ternären Legierung über Mg-Leerstellen-Paare erfolgt. Der Wert der Bindungsenergie ergibt sich zu 0,54 ± 0,08 eV, obwohl ein etwas niedrigerer Wert evenfalls in Übereinstimmung mit der oben gegebenen Erklären wäre.},

Best fitting is obtained with a rather smooth function. The mean size of the zones has been determined: mean diameter of about 70 Å for an alloy aged one year at room temperature, and 110 Å, for an alloy aged the first three months at 40°C and then nine months at room temperature. The corresponding mean distance between the zones is found to be equal to about 130 and 200 Å, respectively.

	abstract = {A study by resistivity measurements at 20°C has been carried out on the effects of small magnesium concentrations (to a magnesium of 1.68 per cent at. fr. Mg) on the annealing out of vacancies frozen-in by quenching aluminium wires (quenching medium: brine at 2°C). The following results are observed: 1.(1) a concentration as small as about 0.13 per cent at. fr. of Mg atoms is sufficient nearly to suppress the annealing out of vacancies which is observed in pure aluminium at room temperature;2.(2) in the meantime we have an increase of resistivity of the sample which is sensitive to the quenching speed;3.(3) this increase is annealed out in isochronal annealing in the range 80–120°C. These facts are easily interpreted if we assume, in agreement with a point of view advanced recently by Ferryman in the case of the examination of other properties of Al-Mg alloys, that magnesium atoms in aluminium are able to trap vacancies at room temperature and that only at about 80–120°C vacancies can free themselves from traps. A preliminary study of the isothermal annealing out of vacancies in the presence of magnesium has shown that the phenomenon is complex and not well understood. Finally, some additional experiments on the isochronal recovery of resistivity of cold-worked Al-Mg alloys have shown that in the same range in which it is possible to observe the recovery after quenching, a larger recovery, the greater the magnesium content, is observed. This result is in agreement with the view of generation of vacancies by cold-working. Des mesures de résistivité ont été effectuées à 20°C en vue d'étudier les effets de concentrations faibles de magnésium (jusqu'à 1,68\%) sur la restauration des lacunes gelées par trempe dans des fils d'aluminium (trempe dans la saumure à 2°C). Les résultats suivants ont été obtenus; 1.(1) une concentration aussi basse que 0,13\% de magnésium est suffisante pour supprimer presque complètement la restauration des lacunes qui est observée dans l'aluminium pur aux températures ordinaires;2.(2) on observe une augmentation de résistivité dépendant de la vitesse de trempe;3.(3) cet accroissement se restaure par un traitement isochrone entre 80 et 120°C. Ces observations peuvent s'interpréter facilement si l'on suppose, en accord avec le point de vue de Ferryman à propos d'autres propriétés des alliages Al-Mg, que les atomes de magnésium sont capables de bloquer des lacunes à la température ordinaire et qu'entre 80 et 120°C, ces lacunes se libèrent de leurs pièges. Une étude préliminaire de la restauration des lacunes en présence de magnésium a montré que le phénomène est complexe et encore mal compris. Enfin des expériences supplémentaires sur la restauration de la résistivité d'alliages Al-Mg écrouis ont montré que dans certaines conditions la restauration est d'autant plus grande que la teneur en magnésium est forte. Ce résultat est en accord avec l'idée de la formation de lacunes par l'écrouissage. Die Erholung eingefrorener Leerstellen in Aluminium in Gegenwart kleiner Magnesiumgehalte (bis zu 1,68 at.\% Mg) wurde durch Widerstandsmessungen bei 20°C untersucht, mit folgenden Ergebnissen: 1.(1) Bereits 0,13 at.\% Mg reichen aus, um das Ausheilen der Leerstellen, welches in reinem Aluminium bei Raumtemperatur auftritt, fast vollständig zu unterdrücken.2.(2) An Stelle dessen bekommt man einen Widerstandsanstieg, der von der Abschreck-Geschwindigkeit abhängt.3.(3) Dieser Anstieg heilt im isochronen Aufheizverfahren zwischen 80°–120°C aus. Diese Tatsachen lassen sich durch die Annahme deuten, die auch Ferryman für andere Eigenschaften von AI-Mg-Legierungen gemacht hat, dass nämlich Mg-Atome in Aluminium Leerstellen bei Raumtemperatur binden können, und dass sich diese erst bei 80° bis 120°C losreissen können. Das isotherme Erholungsverhalten ist in Gegenwart von Magnesium sehr komplex und noch schlecht verstanden. Schliesslich wurde noch die isochrone Erholung des Widerstandes kalt bearbeiteter Al-Mg-Legierungen untersucht, mit dem Ergebnis, dass im gleichen Bereich wie beim Abschrecken eine starke Erholung zu beobachten ist, welche mit wachsendem Magnesium-Gehalt zunimmt. Das ist mit der Vorstellung einer Leerstellenerzeugung bei Verformung im Einklang.},

For a better understanding of these mechanisms, we provide here a thorough study of deformation-induced segregation and precipitation mechanisms in an aluminum alloy containing 5.8 wt.\% Mg subjected to severe plastic deformation (SPD). The solutionized alloy was processed by high-pressure torsion at room temperature and at 200 °C. The investigation of the microstructure and of the distribution of Mg after deformation by scanning transmission electron microscopy and atom probe tomography revealed that clustering and segregations occurred during severe deformation. Mg atoms agglomerate on grain boundaries (GBs), forming mostly nanoscaled clusters at room temperature and more uniform segregation along GBs at 200 °C. In any case, however, the equilibrium Al3Mg2 phase does not nucleate. Using post-deformation annealing treatments, it was found that it can proceed only through a very specific orientation relationship with the face-centered-cubic Al matrix. Both the contribution of dislocations and deformation-induced vacancies were considered to account for the enhanced mobility of Mg atoms. From theoretical estimations it is, however, concluded that Mg atoms are dragged by the vacancy flux toward GBs while dislocations should not play a significant role. These data provide new insights about mechanisms controlling dynamic precipitation and segregation during SPD of aluminum alloys. The segregation and formation of clusters that is revealed can additionally contribute to the strengthening of these alloys, leading to a new understanding of dynamic ageing in non-age-hardenable alloys.},

	abstract = {A study by resistivity measurements at 20°C has been carried out on the effects of small magnesium concentrations (to a magnesium of 1.68 per cent at. fr. Mg) on the annealing out of vacancies frozen-in by quenching aluminium wires (quenching medium: brine at 2°C). The following results are observed: 1.(1) a concentration as small as about 0.13 per cent at. fr. of Mg atoms is sufficient nearly to suppress the annealing out of vacancies which is observed in pure aluminium at room temperature;2.(2) in the meantime we have an increase of resistivity of the sample which is sensitive to the quenching speed;3.(3) this increase is annealed out in isochronal annealing in the range 80–120°C. These facts are easily interpreted if we assume, in agreement with a point of view advanced recently by Ferryman in the case of the examination of other properties of Al-Mg alloys, that magnesium atoms in aluminium are able to trap vacancies at room temperature and that only at about 80–120°C vacancies can free themselves from traps. A preliminary study of the isothermal annealing out of vacancies in the presence of magnesium has shown that the phenomenon is complex and not well understood. Finally, some additional experiments on the isochronal recovery of resistivity of cold-worked Al-Mg alloys have shown that in the same range in which it is possible to observe the recovery after quenching, a larger recovery, the greater the magnesium content, is observed. This result is in agreement with the view of generation of vacancies by cold-working. Des mesures de résistivité ont été effectuées à 20°C en vue d'étudier les effets de concentrations faibles de magnésium (jusqu'à 1,68\%) sur la restauration des lacunes gelées par trempe dans des fils d'aluminium (trempe dans la saumure à 2°C). Les résultats suivants ont été obtenus; 1.(1) une concentration aussi basse que 0,13\% de magnésium est suffisante pour supprimer presque complètement la restauration des lacunes qui est observée dans l'aluminium pur aux températures ordinaires;2.(2) on observe une augmentation de résistivité dépendant de la vitesse de trempe;3.(3) cet accroissement se restaure par un traitement isochrone entre 80 et 120°C. Ces observations peuvent s'interpréter facilement si l'on suppose, en accord avec le point de vue de Ferryman à propos d'autres propriétés des alliages Al-Mg, que les atomes de magnésium sont capables de bloquer des lacunes à la température ordinaire et qu'entre 80 et 120°C, ces lacunes se libèrent de leurs pièges. Une étude préliminaire de la restauration des lacunes en présence de magnésium a montré que le phénomène est complexe et encore mal compris. Enfin des expériences supplémentaires sur la restauration de la résistivité d'alliages Al-Mg écrouis ont montré que dans certaines conditions la restauration est d'autant plus grande que la teneur en magnésium est forte. Ce résultat est en accord avec l'idée de la formation de lacunes par l'écrouissage. Die Erholung eingefrorener Leerstellen in Aluminium in Gegenwart kleiner Magnesiumgehalte (bis zu 1,68 at.\% Mg) wurde durch Widerstandsmessungen bei 20°C untersucht, mit folgenden Ergebnissen: 1.(1) Bereits 0,13 at.\% Mg reichen aus, um das Ausheilen der Leerstellen, welches in reinem Aluminium bei Raumtemperatur auftritt, fast vollständig zu unterdrücken.2.(2) An Stelle dessen bekommt man einen Widerstandsanstieg, der von der Abschreck-Geschwindigkeit abhängt.3.(3) Dieser Anstieg heilt im isochronen Aufheizverfahren zwischen 80°–120°C aus. Diese Tatsachen lassen sich durch die Annahme deuten, die auch Ferryman für andere Eigenschaften von AI-Mg-Legierungen gemacht hat, dass nämlich Mg-Atome in Aluminium Leerstellen bei Raumtemperatur binden können, und dass sich diese erst bei 80° bis 120°C losreissen können. Das isotherme Erholungsverhalten ist in Gegenwart von Magnesium sehr komplex und noch schlecht verstanden. Schliesslich wurde noch die isochrone Erholung des Widerstandes kalt bearbeiteter Al-Mg-Legierungen untersucht, mit dem Ergebnis, dass im gleichen Bereich wie beim Abschrecken eine starke Erholung zu beobachten ist, welche mit wachsendem Magnesium-Gehalt zunimmt. Das ist mit der Vorstellung einer Leerstellenerzeugung bei Verformung im Einklang.},

However, such an EBSD technique is time-consuming and requires data-intensive computing to save and postprocess the results obtained after each scan. In the current work, a simple strategy to transform conventional results into high-resolution results is put forward in an averaging statistical layout. This makes it possible to measure the misorientations more precisely and, subsequently, the geometrically necessary dislocations by lowering the typical noise generated from Hough transformation-based conventional EBSD. Different steel microstructures are analyzed in light of this strategy. The calculated dislocation densities for those microstructures are used as input values for evaluating the initial dislocation density contribution to the yield strength in a newly developed mechanical model.},

	abstract = {Cross-correlation-based analysis of electron back-scatter diffraction (EBSD) patterns has been used to obtain high angular resolution maps of lattice rotations and elastic strains near carbides in a directionally solidified superalloy MAR-M-002. Lattice curvatures were determined from the EBSD measurements and used to estimate the distribution of geometrically necessary dislocations (GNDs) induced by the deformation. Significant strains were induced by thermal treatment due to the lower thermal expansion coefficient of the carbide inclusions compared to that of the matrix. In addition to elastic strains the mismatch was sufficient to have induced localized plastic deformation in the matrix leading to a GND density of 3 × 1013 m–2 in regions around the carbide. Three-point bending was then used to impose strain levels within the range ±12\% across the height of the bend bar. EBSD lattice curvature measurements were then made at both carbide-containing and carbide-free regions at different heights across the bar. The average GND density increases with the magnitude of the imposed strain (both in tension and compression), and is markedly higher near the carbides particles. The higher GND densities near the carbides (order of 1014 m–2) are generated by the large strain gradients produced around the plastically rigid inclusion during mechanical deformation with some minor contribution from the pre-existing residual deformation caused by the thermal mismatch between carbide and nickel matrix.},

	abstract = {The deformation around a 500-nm deep Berkovich indent in a large grained Fe sample has been studied using high resolution electron back scatter diffraction (EBSD). EBSD patterns were obtained in a two-dimensional map around the indent on the free surface. A cross-correlation-based analysis of small shifts in many sub-regions of the EBSD patterns was used to determine the variation of elastic strain and lattice rotations across the map at a sensitivity of ∼±10−4. Elastic strains were smaller than lattice rotations, with radial strains found to be compressive and hoop strains tensile as expected. Several analyses based on Nye's dislocation tensor were used to estimate the distribution of geometrically necessary dislocations (GNDs) around the indent. The results obtained using different assumed dislocation geometries, optimisation routines and different contributions from the measured lattice rotation and strain fields are compared. Our favoured approach is to seek a combination of GND types which support the six measurable (of a possible nine) gradients of the lattice rotations after correction for the 10 measurable elastic strain gradients, and minimise the total GND line energy using an L1 optimisation method. A lower bound estimate for the noise on the GND density determination is ∼±1012 m−2 for a 200-nm step size, and near the indent densities as high as 1015 m−2 were measured. For comparison, a Hough-based analysis of the EBSD patterns has a much higher noise level of ∼±1014m−2 for the GND density.},

The time at artificial ageing was chosen such that samples with approximately the same yield stress were produced. The microstructures of these alloy samples have been carefully characterized using atom probe tomography together with advanced cluster-finding techniques in order to obtain quantitative information about the changes in distribution of both the solute clusters and early-stage precipitates that are formed. The size distribution of clusters has been mapped onto the glide plane and then the stress necessary for a dislocation to pass through the range of obstacles has been estimated using an areal glide model where the dislocation–obstacle interaction strength has been assumed to be related to the obstacle size on the glide plane. It is demonstrated that the contribution of cluster strengthening during artificial aging at higher temperatures is dominated by the high number density of small clusters (Guinier radius \&lt;1 nm), whereas the situation during room temperature natural aging is more complex.},

	abstract = {The small-angle X-ray scattering from cold-worked metals is examined in terms of a double Bragg scattering mechanism. The intensity and angular distribution of the scattering expected from this mechanism are calculated and found to be in accord with experiment. It is shown that this mechanism should give a strongly polarized scattered flux at small angles and that the strong electric vector should be radial in the detecting plane. The polarization of the scattered flux was measured and found in agreement with these predictions. It is concluded that the double Bragg process and not density fluctuation scattering is responsible for most of the observed small-angle scattering. La diffraction des rayons X sous faible angle des métaux déformés à froid est examinée en fonction d'un mécanisme de double diffraction de Bragg. Les auteurs calculent l'intensité et la distribution angulaire de la diffraction résultant de ce mécanisme et ils les trouvent en accord avec l'expérience. Ils montrent que ce mécanisme pourrait donner un flux diffracté très polarisé aux faibles angles et que le vecteur électrique interne devrait être radial dans le plan de détection. La polarisation du flux diffracté a été mesurée. Elle est en accord avec ces hypothèses. Les auteurs concluent que c'est la double diffraction de Bragg et non la variation de densité de la diffraction qui est responsable de la plupart des diffractions à faible angle observées. Die Kleinwinkelstreuung von Röntgenstrahlen in kaltverformten Metallen wird untersucht, indem ein Mechanismus von doppelter Bragg-Reflexion zugrunde gelegt wird. Die nach diesem Mechanismus zu erwartende Intensität und Winkel Verteilung der Streuung werden berechnet; man findet, dass sie mit dem Experiment übereinstimmen. Weiterhin wird gezeigt, dass dieser Mechanismus eine starke Polarisation der um kleine Winkel gestreuten Strahlung ergeben sollte, und dass die starke Komponente des elektrischen Vektors in der Beobachtungsebene radial liegen sollte. Die Polarisation der gestreuten Strahlung wurde gemessen, sie stimmt mit diesen Voraussagen überein. Es ergibt sich der Schluss, dass die doppelte Bragg-Reflexion und nicht die Streuung an Dichteschwankungen für den Hauptanteil der beobachteten Kleinwinkelstreuung verantwortlich ist.},

	abstract = {Measurements and calculations of beam attenuation and background scattering for common materials placed in a neutron beam are presented over the temperature range of 300–700 K. Time-of-flight (TOF) measurements have also been made, to determine the fraction of the background that is either inelastic or quasi-elastic scattering as measured with a 3He detector. Other background sources considered include double Bragg diffraction from windows or samples, scattering from gases, and phonon scattering from solids. Background from the residual air in detector vacuum vessels and scattering from the 3He detector dome are presented. The thickness dependence of the multiple scattering correction for forward scattering from water is calculated. Inelastic phonon background scattering at small angles for crystalline solids is both modeled and compared with measurements. Methods of maximizing the signal-to-noise ratio by material selection, choice of sample thickness and wavelength, removal of inelastic background by TOF or Be filters, and removal of spin-flip scattering with polarized beam analysis are discussed.},

	abstract = {The small-angle X-ray scattering from cold-worked metals is examined in terms of a double Bragg scattering mechanism. The intensity and angular distribution of the scattering expected from this mechanism are calculated and found to be in accord with experiment. It is shown that this mechanism should give a strongly polarized scattered flux at small angles and that the strong electric vector should be radial in the detecting plane. The polarization of the scattered flux was measured and found in agreement with these predictions. It is concluded that the double Bragg process and not density fluctuation scattering is responsible for most of the observed small-angle scattering. La diffraction des rayons X sous faible angle des métaux déformés à froid est examinée en fonction d'un mécanisme de double diffraction de Bragg. Les auteurs calculent l'intensité et la distribution angulaire de la diffraction résultant de ce mécanisme et ils les trouvent en accord avec l'expérience. Ils montrent que ce mécanisme pourrait donner un flux diffracté très polarisé aux faibles angles et que le vecteur électrique interne devrait être radial dans le plan de détection. La polarisation du flux diffracté a été mesurée. Elle est en accord avec ces hypothèses. Les auteurs concluent que c'est la double diffraction de Bragg et non la variation de densité de la diffraction qui est responsable de la plupart des diffractions à faible angle observées. Die Kleinwinkelstreuung von Röntgenstrahlen in kaltverformten Metallen wird untersucht, indem ein Mechanismus von doppelter Bragg-Reflexion zugrunde gelegt wird. Die nach diesem Mechanismus zu erwartende Intensität und Winkel Verteilung der Streuung werden berechnet; man findet, dass sie mit dem Experiment übereinstimmen. Weiterhin wird gezeigt, dass dieser Mechanismus eine starke Polarisation der um kleine Winkel gestreuten Strahlung ergeben sollte, und dass die starke Komponente des elektrischen Vektors in der Beobachtungsebene radial liegen sollte. Die Polarisation der gestreuten Strahlung wurde gemessen, sie stimmt mit diesen Voraussagen überein. Es ergibt sich der Schluss, dass die doppelte Bragg-Reflexion und nicht die Streuung an Dichteschwankungen für den Hauptanteil der beobachteten Kleinwinkelstreuung verantwortlich ist.},

Since there is, in general, a long-range interaction between a point defect and a dislocation, the kinetics of the migration of the point defects to the dislocations will depend on the form and magnitude of this interaction. The origin of the interaction and the various spatial forms it can take are therefore discussed in some detail and related to the resulting kinetics. The early stages of this segregation process can be explained and the kinetics satisfactorily correlated with experimental observations without a detailed discussion of the physical situation prevailing at the dislocation cores. However, in the later stages of the segregation process the observed kinetics very often show a strong departure from simple first order and, in this case, an explanation requires a discussion of the detailed point-defect behaviour within the dislocation core region. Various physically plausible dislocation core situations are discussed and related, where possible, to pertinent experimental observations.},

From the comparison between both approaches we obtain the minimal separation distance where elasticity applies and we estimate the degree of refinement required in the calculation. In this purpose, isotropic and anisotropic elasticity is used assuming a perfect or a dissociated edge dislocation and considering the size effect as well as the inhomogeneity interaction.},

X-ray diffraction measurements indicated that within experimental error there was a zero change in lattice parameter after plasma charging. This result is contradictory to almost all other face-centred cubic (f.c.c.) materials, which exhibit a lattice expansion when the hydrogen enters the lattice interstitially. It is hypothesized that the hydrogen does not enter the lattice as an interstitial solute, but instead forms an H–vacancy complex at the surface that diffuses into the volume and then clusters to form H2 bubbles. Small- and ultra-small-angle neutron scattering (SANS, USANS) and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) were primarily employed to study the nature and agglomeration of the H–vacancy complexes in the Al–H system. The SAXS results were ambiguous owing to double Bragg scattering, but the SANS and USANS investigation, coupled with results from inelastic neutron scattering, and transmission and scanning electron microscopy, revealed the existence of a large size distribution of hydrogen bubbles on the surface and in the bulk of the Al–H system. The relative change in lattice parameter is calculated from the pressure in a bubble of average volume and is compared with the experimentally determined value.},

	abstract = {Using ultrasonic shear waves, we study the kinetics of migration of vacancy to dislocations in aluminum. Ultrasonic attenuation is sensitive to the effective dislocation length, which is shortened by the segregation of point defects. Two principal measurements were done: (i) measurement of temperature dependence of decay behavior of attenuation after elastic deformation; (ii) continuous measurement of attenuation of a specimen quenched from 573 K to cold-water and then to liquid-nitrogen temperatures. The specimens were polycrystalline and monocrystal aluminum with 99.995\% purity. The former measurement provided us with the activation energy 0.28 eV for migration of dominant point defects through the Granato–Hikata–Lücke theory. The latter measurement informed us of the kinetics of vacancy: the attenuation coefficient rapidly decreased twice at 125 and 250 K, corresponding to activation energies 0.28 and 0.61 eV for migration, respectively. Thus, the same mechanism occurs for the attenuation change after elastic deformation and at 125 K after quenching. We attributed the 0.28-eV migration as fast diffusion of vacancy along dislocations. The 0.61-eV migration is consistent with the bulk diffusion of vacancy in aluminum. Throughout this study, the electromagnetic acoustic resonance method was used for making noncontacting and highly accurate measurement of attenuation.},

	abstract = {A study by resistivity measurements at 20°C has been carried out on the effects of small magnesium concentrations (to a magnesium of 1.68 per cent at. fr. Mg) on the annealing out of vacancies frozen-in by quenching aluminium wires (quenching medium: brine at 2°C). The following results are observed: 1.(1) a concentration as small as about 0.13 per cent at. fr. of Mg atoms is sufficient nearly to suppress the annealing out of vacancies which is observed in pure aluminium at room temperature;2.(2) in the meantime we have an increase of resistivity of the sample which is sensitive to the quenching speed;3.(3) this increase is annealed out in isochronal annealing in the range 80–120°C. These facts are easily interpreted if we assume, in agreement with a point of view advanced recently by Ferryman in the case of the examination of other properties of Al-Mg alloys, that magnesium atoms in aluminium are able to trap vacancies at room temperature and that only at about 80–120°C vacancies can free themselves from traps. A preliminary study of the isothermal annealing out of vacancies in the presence of magnesium has shown that the phenomenon is complex and not well understood. Finally, some additional experiments on the isochronal recovery of resistivity of cold-worked Al-Mg alloys have shown that in the same range in which it is possible to observe the recovery after quenching, a larger recovery, the greater the magnesium content, is observed. This result is in agreement with the view of generation of vacancies by cold-working. Des mesures de résistivité ont été effectuées à 20°C en vue d'étudier les effets de concentrations faibles de magnésium (jusqu'à 1,68\%) sur la restauration des lacunes gelées par trempe dans des fils d'aluminium (trempe dans la saumure à 2°C). Les résultats suivants ont été obtenus; 1.(1) une concentration aussi basse que 0,13\% de magnésium est suffisante pour supprimer presque complètement la restauration des lacunes qui est observée dans l'aluminium pur aux températures ordinaires;2.(2) on observe une augmentation de résistivité dépendant de la vitesse de trempe;3.(3) cet accroissement se restaure par un traitement isochrone entre 80 et 120°C. Ces observations peuvent s'interpréter facilement si l'on suppose, en accord avec le point de vue de Ferryman à propos d'autres propriétés des alliages Al-Mg, que les atomes de magnésium sont capables de bloquer des lacunes à la température ordinaire et qu'entre 80 et 120°C, ces lacunes se libèrent de leurs pièges. Une étude préliminaire de la restauration des lacunes en présence de magnésium a montré que le phénomène est complexe et encore mal compris. Enfin des expériences supplémentaires sur la restauration de la résistivité d'alliages Al-Mg écrouis ont montré que dans certaines conditions la restauration est d'autant plus grande que la teneur en magnésium est forte. Ce résultat est en accord avec l'idée de la formation de lacunes par l'écrouissage. Die Erholung eingefrorener Leerstellen in Aluminium in Gegenwart kleiner Magnesiumgehalte (bis zu 1,68 at.\% Mg) wurde durch Widerstandsmessungen bei 20°C untersucht, mit folgenden Ergebnissen: 1.(1) Bereits 0,13 at.\% Mg reichen aus, um das Ausheilen der Leerstellen, welches in reinem Aluminium bei Raumtemperatur auftritt, fast vollständig zu unterdrücken.2.(2) An Stelle dessen bekommt man einen Widerstandsanstieg, der von der Abschreck-Geschwindigkeit abhängt.3.(3) Dieser Anstieg heilt im isochronen Aufheizverfahren zwischen 80°–120°C aus. Diese Tatsachen lassen sich durch die Annahme deuten, die auch Ferryman für andere Eigenschaften von AI-Mg-Legierungen gemacht hat, dass nämlich Mg-Atome in Aluminium Leerstellen bei Raumtemperatur binden können, und dass sich diese erst bei 80° bis 120°C losreissen können. Das isotherme Erholungsverhalten ist in Gegenwart von Magnesium sehr komplex und noch schlecht verstanden. Schliesslich wurde noch die isochrone Erholung des Widerstandes kalt bearbeiteter Al-Mg-Legierungen untersucht, mit dem Ergebnis, dass im gleichen Bereich wie beim Abschrecken eine starke Erholung zu beobachten ist, welche mit wachsendem Magnesium-Gehalt zunimmt. Das ist mit der Vorstellung einer Leerstellenerzeugung bei Verformung im Einklang.},

Transmission electron microscopy was used to characterize the average size, the size distribution, the volume fraction, and the crystal structure of the hardening precipitates for aging at 180 °C (a) directly after solution treatment and (b) following 2 weeks of natural aging. The results indicate that both β″ and Q′ phases co-exist throughout the aging cycle with the relative amount of Q′ being increased both with increased aging time at 180 °C and when natural aging precedes aging at 180 °C. A strengthening model was developed which uses the size distribution and the volume fraction of precipitates as the primary inputs to predict the yield stress. An important feature of this model was that only one fitting parameter was necessary to give very good agreement with the experimental results.},

	abstract = {It is shown that the small-angle scattering of X-rays or neutrons by dislocations within a deformed metal, which are partially ordered into wall-like structures, is characterized by several factors. Principally these are associated with: (i) a single dislocation or dipole; (ii) the dislocation configuration in the plane of the wall; and (iii) the distribution of dislocations across the wall thickness. With the assumption of isotropic elasticity, small-angle scattering will be sensitive only to the edge components of the dislocations. The scattered intensity is dominated by scattering from dislocations that lie perpendicular to the scattering vector, , and reaches a maximum when  is normal to the slip plane of these dislocations. Above a particular , the scattered intensity is sensitive only to the total edge dislocation content of the scattering dislocations (i.e. scattering is incoherent), while, below this value, the scattering is dominated by how the dislocations are distributed in walls. For walls normal to their slip planes, the configuration factor will reflect the dislocation distribution in the plane of the wall, while, for walls parallel to their slip planes, the distribution in the thickness direction will be visible. Therefore, even though a deformed material is composed of complicated dislocation structures, only those segments conforming to these rather strict prescriptions will be singled out for scattering, and, by adjusting the beam/slip system geometry, many parameters of the microstructure can be determined experimentally.},

The strain history during a rolling pass is idealized by superimposing a sine-shaped evolution of the ε˙ε˙{\textbackslash}dot {\textbackslash}varepsilon 13 shear component to a plane-strain state. These generic strain histories are enforced in a visco-plastic self-consistent (VPSC) polycrystal deformation model to simulate texture evolution as a function of through-thickness position. The VPSC scheme is deemed superior to a full constraints (FC) or relaxed constraints (RC) approach, because it allows one to fully prescribe diagonal and shear-strain-rate components while still accounting for grain-shape effects. The idealized strain states are validated by comparison with deformation histories obtained through finite-element method (FEM) calculations. The through-thickness texture gradients are accounted for by introducing a relative variation of the sine-shaped ε˙ε˙{\textbackslash}dot {\textbackslash}varepsilon 13 shear with respect to the plane-strain component. The simulation results are validated, in turn, by comparison with typical examples of through-thickness texture gradients observed experimentally in rolled plates and in sheets of fcc and bcc materials.},

	abstract = {Copper interconnects in advanced integrated circuits are manufactured by processes that include electrodeposition, chemical mechanical polishing and annealing. The as-deposited copper is nano-crystalline and undergoes a microstructure evolution at room temperature (self-annealing) or during an annealing step. During this process, significant changes in resistivity and grain size are observed. In this work, the microstructure evolution in 0.5-3 μm-thick electrodeposited copper thin films was studied. Resistivity measurements were used to quantify the role of deposition conditions on the microstructure evolution rate. In-situ electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) was employed to observe self-annealing at the film surface. The resistivity-microstructure correlation during self-annealing was examined. A phenomenological model using the Johnson-Mehl-Avrami-Kolmogorov (JMAK) approach was developed to describe recrystallization during isothermal and continuous annealing treatments. The microstructure evolution in copper-silver alloys and films produced by variable deposition rates was investigated. Phase-field model was applied to simulate self-annealing and the effect of deposition current density.

The results show that the drop in resistivity during self-annealing is accompanied by significant changes of the microstructure at the film surface. Different criteria were developed to assess self-annealing rate from EBSD maps including grain size, image quality and local orientation spread. Adopting a grain size threshold, it was found that there is a reasonable correlation between resistivity and microstructure during self-annealing. The recrystallization in copper thin films appears to be thermally activated with an activation energy of 0.89-0.93 eV. Adopting the principle of additivity, it was found that the recrystallization rate during continuous annealing can be described by the JMAK model using the isothermal resistivity profiles. A method was proposed to accelerate recrystallization based on a capping layer deposition. No recrystallization was observed when silver was co-deposited with copper in the absence of chloride (even when annealed at 100 °C for 5 hours). Phase-field model was able to describe self-annealing and the effect of deposition current density. The results in this thesis are of significance to the microelectronic industry where recrystallization is a crucial step in the fabrication of copper interconnects for the high performance integrated circuits.},

	abstract = {In recent years there has been a renewal of interest in fundamental studies on 6000 series aluminum alloys due to new applications in the automotive and aerospace industries. The work of this thesis focuses on two new approaches to investigating the behaviour of the Al-Mg-Si-Cu alloy, AA6111. First, the temporal evolution of electrical resistivity was measured over a wide range of annealing temperatures (i.e. 200°C to 560°C). From the resistivity data, an approach has been established for extracting the fundamental thermodynamic properties of Q precipitate and, in addition, an estimate of the effect of precipitate spacing on resistivity for a wide range of conditions was developed. Both of these results represent an original approach to relating electrical resistivity measurements to the state of precipitation in the alloy. The second subject of investigation involved applying thermal spikes (of duration 30 to 300 s) in the temperature range of 220-250°C on material either immediately after the solution treatment or following a period of natural aging. It was found that a 60-second spike at 220°C applied to the alloy immediately after solution treatment can inhibit the deterioration of the paint bake response due to natural aging. In general, it was observed that utilizing the thermal spikes immediately after solution treatment provides a better paint bake response than applying the spike after the natural aging period. Finally, the precipitation hardening model of Esmaeili et al. was extended to examine the temperature-time histories of the thermal spikes. In general, it was found that there was good agreement between the model predictions and the experimental results except for the shortest thermal spike experiments.},

These property changes are attributed to the formation of copper enriched clusters which are presumed to be Guinier-Preston zones or their precursors. The kinetics of this clustering in the temperature range 25°C to −45°C were investigated. It was found that the isothermal rate of clustering continuously decreases with increasing time and is greatly decreased (by factors of 10–100) by interruption of the quench from the homogenization temperature at 200°C for a few seconds.

The activation energy for low temperature clustering is about 12 kcal/g atom which is near that for the annealing out of the quenched-in point defects in pure aluminum. The results are consistent with the hypothesis of Zener and Seitz that the clustering is effected by point defects retained in quenching from a high temperature. However, the dislocation glide mechanism is not yet ruled out.},

We employ an approach called “diffusive molecular dynamics,” which can capture the diffusional time scale while maintaining atomic resolution by coarse graining over atomic vibrations and evolving atomic density clouds. We find that, unlike the Thomson-Balluffi mechanism, if simultaneous displacive and diffusive events are allowed, a coupled displacive-diffusional pathway exists for extended double jog formation. Along this pathway, the activation energy is lower than the previous theoretical predictions and on par with the experimental observations.},

One interesting result is that the resistivity excess observed during coarsening mainly arises from large clusters and not really from the solid solution. As a consequence, one cannot assume that resistivity asymptotic behavior obeys a simple power law as predicted by LSW theory for the solid solution supersaturation. This forbids any derivation of the precipitate interface free energy or of the solute diffusion coefficient from resistivity experimental data in a phase-separating system like AlSc supersaturated alloys.},

This comparative study shows that STEM in SEM, a technique much easier to undertake compared to TEM, is perfectly adapted for size distribution measurements of second phase particles, with sizes ranging between 5 and 200 nm in these systems.},

Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was combined with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and hardness measurement to examine the precipitate evolution in this alloy. A non-isothermal age-hardening heat treatment was performed to allow for a direct comparison to DSC results. Thermodynamic analysis aided in identifying ageing heat treatments to further de-convolute the overlapping DSC data. Results suggested the precipitation events followed sequential evolution towards the formation of two types of equilibrium phases (i.e. Mg2Ca and Mg6Ca2Zn3). Early stage decomposition of the solid solution had no observable effect on hardness, but was followed by the formation of hardening GP zones. Fine basal plates, as well as large coarse basal plates of Mg2Ca-type formed on further ageing. Contrast due to fine unidentified nanoscale precipitates was also observed in the over-aged state. These precipitates tended to disappear, while blocky Mg2Ca equilibrium phase precipitates formed as the heat treatment progressed to the highest temperature studied (i.e. 300 °C). However, the equilibrium Mg6Ca2Zn3phase was not observed when this final test temperature was achieved at the end of the non-isothermal heat treatment process.},

The results reveal that the yield stress decreases linearly with the temperature and increases approximately linearly with the Mg content in the solution. The thermomechanical and Portevin–Le Chatelier instabilities dominate the flow stress behaviour of alloys at 4 K and 298 K. Dynamics of these instabilities increases with the solute content. It is argued that neither PLC nor adiabatic instabilities contribute to the premature failure of the samples. The work-hardening can be reproduced by the Voce type scaling law in a broad range of temperatures. The mean slip distance obtained from the macroscopic model of work hardening is correlated to the scale of the referenced microstructure; Λ min is interpreted as a transition from cell-like to micro shear band microstructure. The failure is discussed in terms of a critical point in a transition form unsaturated to saturated with defects dislocation substructure.},

	abstract = {Residual stress, Young's modulus and practical adhesion of different thickness organic layers made of DGEBA epoxy resin and IPD hardener were determined. Coatings were deposited on aluminum alloy (5754) after degreasing and chemical etching. Both bi-layer (having a perfect interface with a null thickness) and three-layer models (having a real interphase between the organic coating and the substrate) were considered to evaluate residual stress and Young's modulus of the entire coating, the polymer/metal interphase and the remaining part of the coating which have the bulk properties. Coatings, interphase and bulk properties (Tg, reaction extent and interphase thickness) were determined by using differential thermal analysis (DSC) and FTNIR spectroscopy. Young's modulus, curvature radii of coated samples and practical adhesion were determined by three point flexure test. Results show the bi-layer model limitation when a coating/substrate interphase is formed. Interphase thicknesses of 200 and 250 μm were obtained for respectively degreasing and chemical etching. For the same coating formulation and the same curing conditions, amine conversion, Tg of the entire coatings, residual stresses at interfaces interphase/metal and bulk coating/interphase, Young's modulus and practical adhesion depend on the nature of the substrate treatment and on the coating thickness. For thick coatings mechanical, physical and chemical properties are equal to the bulk one. For thin coatings significant differences compared to the bulk properties were observed. Variations of both residual stress and Young's modulus were observed according to different surface treatments. Residual stress intensities at the interphase/substrate interface are higher than the ones at the coating/substrate interface. For thin coatings on chemically etched substrate, Young's modulus is more important than degreased substrate one. On the contrary, residual stress intensities are lower for chemical etching than the degreasing ones. When adhesional failure was observed, the adherence increases when internal stresses at the interface between the metal and the formed interphase decrease.},

	abstract = {The impact of annealing twin boundaries with a high residual defect content on the mechanical response of polycrystalline fine- and coarse-grained (2 and 20 μm) silver was investigated through transmission electron microscopy and modeling. Besides an increase in the yield strength, the fine-grained material exhibited an inflection in the stress–strain curve after initial yield. Static and dynamic TEM studies revealed that the annealing twin boundaries acted as sources of perfect dislocations, partial dislocations and deformation twins; as barriers to the propagation of these dislocations; and as annihilation sites for dislocations. With increasing strain and as the twin boundaries were penetrated by dislocations, they contributed less to the overall mechanical properties. Based on these observations, equations for the evolution of mobile and forest dislocation densities are posed, depicting boundary sources and dislocation–dislocation interactions, respectively. The deformation response is modeled by computing the aggregate response of matrix–twin composite grains in the viscoplastic self-consistent scheme, which permits consideration of compatibility and equilibrium requirements across the twin boundaries. This work highlights the significant role boundaries play in generating the dislocations that control the macroscopic mechanical response.},

During artificial aging, significant changes in the work-hardening rate were observed as the precipitation reaction proceeded. A semiempirical model has been developed to interpret these changes in work-hardening rate. This model shows that the significant changes in work-hardening rate can be related to the manner in which flow stress contributions from different obstacles are summed and the transition from shearable to nonshearable precipitates. The present study presents a new approach to determining the shearable/nonshearable transition from a series of tensile tests. Results on the aluminum alloy AA7030 were also found to be consistent with the proposed theoretical framework. Finally, the proposed model allows the overall mechanical response for a variety of aging conditions to be rationalized.},

The model is composed of two stepwise simulation scales; the first scale is a finite element model of a polycrystal using a novel single-crystal constitutive equation and the second scale redistributes the mobile part of the dislocation density within grains consistent with the plastic strain distribution, and enforces slip transmission criteria at grain boundaries that depend on local grain and boundary properties.In this work, deformation of Fe–3\% Si tensile specimen is simulated using SDM to compare dislocation densities obtained from the high-resolution electron backscatter diffraction (HR-EBSD). The model accurately predicts the measured dislocation density at 10\% deformation. In addition, size-dependent simulations show that the model qualitatively predicts Hall–Petch slope as well as the grain boundary strength of Fe–3\% Si.},

The aim of this paper is to present a coupled approach able to describe precipitation and associated yield stresses for non-isothermal treatments of a 6061 aluminium alloy. The precipitation state (in terms of volume fraction and precipitate size distribution) is modelled thanks to a recent implementation of the classical nucleation and growth theories for needle-shaped precipitates. The precipitation model is validated through small-angle neutron scattering and transmission electron microscopy experiments. The precipitation size distribution is then used as an entry parameter of a micromechanical model for the yield strength of the alloy. Predicted yield stresses are compared to tensile tests performed with various heating conditions, representative of the heat-affected zone of a welded joint.},

We have studied the relation between the softening kinetics of martensite and the kinetics of the evolution of the microstructure in high-purity Fe–C–Mn steel during tempering at 300 °C by means of nano-indentation, SEM, and EBSD. The as-quenched specimen consist of martensite blocks that are auto-tempered and non-tempered. We find that the nano-hardness that is measured directly at the martensite boundaries is significantly higher than the nano-hardness that is measured in the martensite matrix. The boundary regions soften with increasing tempering time, whereas the nano-hardness of the tempered matrix remains approximately constant with increasing tempering time. The kinetics of martensite softening can be described by three stages that are related to the evolution of the microstructure. However, most of the softening takes place during the first stage of tempering: The macroscopic softening of martensite is mainly related to: (i) the nano-scale softening of boundary regions, (ii) the reduction in area fraction of the boundaries regions, and (iii) the reduction in area fraction of the non-tempered matrix regions.},

Various specimen-holder geometries and detector arrangements have been used for bright-field (BF) STEM-in-SEM imaging. In this study, to further the characterization potential of STEM-IN-SEM, a new specimen holder has been developed to facilitate direct detection of BF signals and indirect detection of dark-field (DF) signals without the need for substantial instrument modification. DF imaging is conducted with the use of a gold (Au)-coated copper (Cu) plate attached to the specimen holder which directs highly scattered transmitted electrons to an off-axis yttrium-aluminum-garnet (YAG) detector. A hole in the copper plate allows for BF imaging with a transmission electron (TE) detector. The inclusion of an Au-coated Cu plate enhanced DF signal intensity. Experiments validating the acquisition of true DF signals revealed that atomic number (Z) contrast may be achieved for materials with large lattice spacing. However, materials with small lattice spacing still exhibit diffraction contrast effects in this approach. The calculated theoretical fine probe size is 1.8 nm. At 30 kV, in this indirect approach, DF spatial resolution is limited to 3.2 nm as confirmed experimentally.},

Precipitation start–time–temperature diagrams were determined by means of hot torsion tests and nucleation periods were measured at strains of 0.20 and 0.35. The increase in the dislocation density caused by the strain was calculated for both strains, and the driving forces for precipitation were also calculated. The results show that the influence of the strain on the nucleation time (t0.05) is dependent not only on the strain magnitude but also on the driving force for precipitation. When the driving force is high, or low in absolute terms, the influence of the strain, i.e. the increase in the dislocation density, gives rise to a notable reduction in the t0.05 value due to heterogeneous nucleation on the dislocation nodes. In contrast, when the driving force is low, or high in absolute terms, the influence of the strain on t0.05 decreases considerably and the nucleation of precipitates becomes preponderantly homogeneous. Therefore, the driving force value is responsible for the transition from heterogeneous nucleation to homogenous nucleation.},

The availability of more sensitive analytic methods has made it possible to measure lead at much lower concentrations. This advance, along with more refined epidemiological techniques and better outcome measures, has lowered the least observable effect level until it approaches zero. As a consequence, the segment of the population who are diagnosed with exposure to toxic levels has expanded. At the same time, environmental efforts, most importantly the removal of lead from gasoline, have dramatically reduced the amount of lead in the biosphere. The remaining major source of lead is older housing stock. Although the cost of lead paint abatement is measured in billions of dollars, the monetized benefits of such a Herculean task have been shown to far outweigh the costs.},

Thus, depending on both the nitrogen and the silicon contents, the fcc-TaxSiyNz films can exhibit room temperature resistivity values ranging from 102 μΩ cm to about 6 × 104 μΩ cm.},

Single Cu and Ag solute/dislocation interaction energy calculations showed that Cu interacts strongly with an Al extended dislocation and prefers sites in the compressive region, in agreement with elasticity theory predictions. Single Ag atoms, however, are strongly repelled by an Al extended dislocation, in contrast with elasticity theory predictions. Monte Carlo simulations of Al: 1\% Cu, Al: 2\% Cu, Al: 1\% Ag, Al: 0.5\% Cu, 0.5\% Ag, and Al: 0.75\% Cu, 0.25\% Ag were carried out in the presence of an extended dislocation dipole at 600 K allowing for solute segregation. Cu atoms in the binary alloys were observed to segregate to the compressive regions of the extended dislocation dipole, forming widespread “atmospheres” over the width of both extended dislocations which did not affect the partial dislocation spacing. Ag in the binary alloy formed small Ag zones which also had little influence on the spacing between the partials. The ternary systems, however, exhibited highly localized solute clusters that had a large impact on the extended dislocation dipole structure, increasing the separation between the partial dislocations. The resulting cluster structures are discussed along with their influence on the apparent stacking fault energy of the alloy systems.},

We derive an analytic expression for the strengthening versus strain rate and temperature that justifies widely used phenomenological forms, provides specific dependences of the parameters on material properties and is supported by atomistic kinetic Monte Carlo simulations. Using literature material properties, the predicted strengthening quantitatively agrees with the experimentally derived behaviour of Al–2.5\% Mg at 300 K, and qualitatively agrees with the strain rate and temperature ranges of DSA and nSRS in Al–Mg alloys. The analyses herein show a clear path for multiscale design, from quantum to continuum mechanics, of solute strengthening in face-centred-cubic metal alloys.},

These diffusion barriers were prepared by reactive magnetron sputtering in N2/Ar gas mixtures. Next, barrier performance was evaluated by annealing the Cu/barrier/Si systems at 400–1,000°C for 60 min. in vacuum as well as the measurements of copper diffusion coefficients. The results suggest that TiZrN films can be used as a diffusion barrier for copper metallization better than the well-known TaN films.

While the bumps of one of the models are realistic with 6 μm thickness of intermetallic compound (IMC) at interconnects of solder and bond pads, the other are made up of conventional bumps without IMC at these interconnects. The solder bump profiles were created using a combination of analytical method and construction geometry. The assembled package on PCB was accelerated thermally cycled (ATC) using IEC standard 60749-25. It was found in the result of the simulation that IMC does not only impact solder joint reliability but also is a key factor of fatigue failure of solder joints. The IMC sandwiched between bond pad at chip side and solder bulk is the most critical and its interface with solder bulk is the most vulnerable site of damage. With reference to our results, it is proposed that non inclusion of IMC in solder joint models composed of Sn-based solder and metalized copper substrate is one of the major causes of the discrepancy on solder joint fatigue life predicted using finite element modelling and the one obtained through experimental investigation.},

	copyright = {http://www.library.usyd.edu.au/copyright.html},

	abstract = {The evolution of atomistic-level nanostructure during the early stages of both standard, high-temperature T6 heat treatment, and low-temperature secondary ageing after interruption of the former (T6I4), has been investigated in rapid hardening Al-Cu-Mg alloys using a variety of microscopy and microanalytical techniques, including transmission electron microscopy (TEM), positron annihilation spectroscopy (PAS) and atom probe tomography (APT). In order to carry out this objective, quantitative data-analysis methods were developed with respect to new cluster-finding algorithms, specifically designed for use with three-dimensional APT data.

Prior to this detailed characterisation work, the actual thermal impact from both heat treatment and quenching of small, lab-scale specimens was determined through correlation of both experimental results and calculations that modelled the heat transfer conditions using the lumped capacitance method. Subsequently, the maximum diffusion distance by random walk of the solute atoms was calculated for these periods, bearing significance on the propensity for these atoms to have the ability to cluster together, rather than segregate to the dislocation loops in the microstructure, which have a relatively larger interspacing distance.

Age-hardening curves for the Al-1.1Cu-xMg (x = 0, 0.2, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.7 at.\%) alloys at 150ºC show that the rapid hardening phenomenon (RHP) exists for Mg compositions ≥ 0.5Mg. Given that zone-like precipitate structures were unable to be detected by TEM or APT during the early stages of ageing at 150ºC, and that statistically significant dispersions of clusters were found in the APT data after ageing for 60 s, the RHP is attributed to these clustering reactions. Identification of clusters in the APT data has been achieved using the core-linkage algorithm and they have been found to be quite small, containing only a few atoms up to a couple of tens of atoms. The RHP is governed by some critical number density of both Mg clusters and Cu-Mg co-clusters of a critical size, whereas Cu clusters do not contribute significantly to the hardening mechanism. Significance testing indicates that Mg clusters are more significant at smaller clusters sizes and Cu-Mg co-clusters more important at larger cluster sizes.

Hardness results also confirm the existence of rapid early hardening during secondary ageing at 65ºC in Al-1.1Cu-1.7Mg. The mechanism of secondary rapid hardening involves a combination of both secondary clustering from solute (mainly Mg atoms) residual in solution, and pre-existing amorphous primary clusters that have slower growth kinetics at the lower secondary ageing temperature. The latter occurs mainly by vacancy-assisted diffusion of Mg atoms as evidenced by the gradual increase of the Mg:Cu ratio of co-clusters.

From an alloy design point of view it is important to fully understand the solute distribution in the microstructure to be able to subsequently optimise the configuration for enhanced material properties. The change in dispersion of solute atoms during ageing was determined by combining calculations of \% vacancy-solute associations with detailed measurements of the dislocation loops to estimate the solute distribution within the microstructure. The implication of the balance of solute atoms segregated to the loops compared with that in the matrix is then discussed in the context of hardnening mechanisms.},

	abstract = {The Cottrell–Stokes (CS) law requires that the ratio between the flow stress at two temperatures and same material structure (the CS ratio) is a function of the two temperatures involved and is independent of strain. This holds in many pure single and polycrystalline metals and provides fundamental insight into the nature of thermally activated plastic flow. The standard method for testing the validity of the law in given material system is to monitor the dependence of the strain rate sensitivity coefficient S on the applied stress, i.e. the Haasen plot. It is conjectured in the literature that if the Haasen plot is a straight line passing through the origin, the Cottrell–Stokes law holds. In this article we study this conjecture using a model of thermally activated dislocation motion across arrays of obstacles. It is shown that multiple types of Haasen plots may be obtained at constant CS ratio, i.e. when the CS law is imposed at all times. Hence, the validity of the CS law cannot be determined exclusively based on the Haasen plot. As a corollary it is shown that S is a convex function of the flow stress.},

The work hardening behaviour was quantified by numerically differentiating the data from tensile tests. In addition, strain rate change tests were conducted during tensile tests at 77 K. It was observed that the work hardening behaviour was a strong function of test temperature and precipitation condition. In particular, it was found that the supersaturated solid solution showed particularly high work hardening characteristics. For the samples aged for 1 and 6 h, a high initial work hardening rate was observed followed by a rapid drop in the hardening rate. Finally, for the overaged material, it was observed that the hardening rate decreased at a higher rate than high purity aluminum. Strain rate change data showed that for the obstacles formed in the early stages of ageing, thermal activation was important, while for overaged conditions, thermal activation became less significant.

Transmission electron microscopy showed that two distinct dislocation processes occur: 1.
(1) a rapid tightening of tangles and loose cell walls, eventually into subgrain boundaries, without a noticeable change in the scale of the structure, and
2.
(2) subsequent coarsening of the subgrain structure.
These two processes of microstructural change were correlated respectively with two distinct types (I and II) of stress vs strain behavior during postanneal straining. After ‘Type I recovery’, the relation between the strain-hardening rate, θ = dσ/dϵ (σ: true stress, ϵ: true strain), and the true stress is identical to that of an unrecovered specimen, after a transient of a few percent of post-anneal straining. Type I recovery encompasses all of ‘metarecovery’ and part of ‘orthorecovery’, and bears resemblance to ‘dynamic recovery’ processes during stage III strain-hardening. Type II recovery, which succeeds Type I recovery, shows long-lasting effects on the mechanical behavior which are characterized in particular by unusually low θ values compared to unrecovered specimens deformed to the same stress. It may correspond to some transition stage between recovery and recrystallization.},

Theories have rationalized two different scaling laws for the total strength, TeX {\textbackslash}tau\_\{t\}{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}alpha \} = {\textbackslash}tau\_\{1\}{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}alpha \} + {\textbackslash}tau\_\{2\}{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}alpha \} , with α = 1 or 2, where τ 1 and τ 2 are the strengths of the two individual obstacle types. Simulations have clearly demonstrated α = 2, while “friction” strengthening must correspond to α = 1. Here, line-tension simulations of dislocation glide through two types of point obstacles are performed to examine the friction limit. One obstacle type is weak (critical angle approaching 180 deg) but with very high density, approximately corresponding to solute strengthening; and the second obstacle type is stronger (smaller critical angle) but with lower density, approximately corresponding to forest or precipitate strengthening. Additive strengthening α = 1 is obtained when the densities of the two obstacle types differ by more than a factor of {\textasciitilde}67, while a transition to α = 2 occurs with increasing density of the second obstacle. These simulations confirm the long-held metallurgical wisdom regarding additivity of solute or friction strengthening with other strengthening mechanisms and also demonstrate that apparent intermediate scaling laws with 1 {\textless} α {\textless} 2 can arise for a range of relative obstacle densities. Investigation of several literature experimental studies shows some agreement with the model here but quantitative comparisons remain difficult.},

The model builds on analytic concepts developed by Labusch but introduces key innovations rectifying shortcomings of previous models. To accurately describe the solute/dislocation interaction energies in and around the dislocation core, density functional theory and a flexible-boundary-condition method are used. The model then predicts the zero temperature flow stress, the energy barrier for dislocation motion, and thus the finite temperature flow stresses. The model is used to predict the flow stresses of various Al alloys. Excellent results are obtained for Al–Mg and Al–Mn. Al–Fe with ppm levels of Fe is not predicted well but, using experimental results for Fe, results for the quasi-binary Al–Cr–(Fe) and Al–Cu–(Fe) alloys agree well with experiments. The model is also consistent with the “stress equivalency” postulate of Basinski. This parameter-free model using first-principles input thus provides a basis for achieving the long-sought goal of computational design of alloys, within the context of solute-strengthening mechanisms.},

How to add the strengthening contributions of these obstacles to predict yield stresses and work hardening is an important question. To answer this question, a 2D areal glide model based on the method of Nogaret and Rodney that simulates the glide of a single dislocation through an array of randomly distributed point obstacles was used.

From an initial fully precipitated T6 state, various non-isothermal heat treatments are performed, leading to various precipitation states. This paper focuses on the effect of precipitates on yield stress, and on kinematic and isotropic hardening. In parallel, the elastoplastic behaviour is modelled coupling a recently developed multi-class precipitation model to an adaptation of the classical Kocks–Mecking–Estrin formalism. In addition to the classical isotropic effect of solid solution, precipitates and dislocation forests, the proposed model takes into account the kinematic contribution of grain boundaries as well as precipitates, thus providing a new physical meaning to the Armstrong–Frederick law. The resulting cyclic stress–strain curves compare well with the experimental ones for all treatments and strain levels.},

	abstract = {It has become apparent through experimentation at the micro- and nanolevels that the crystalline defects known as dislocations have significant effects on a material’s properties. Accordingly, a complete material state description must include the characterization of the dislocated state. However, this characterization presents a twofold problem: resolution and representation. In general, high-resolution microscopy techniques are only useful for considering a few dislocations at a time, but automated high-speed methods are only capable of resolving dislocation densities well above the average density in a typical annealed metal. The second challenge is developing a method of representation for the dislocated state. Unlike most state quantities, dislocation lengths are not conserved and complete representation would require tracking of position, momentum, and interactions, as well as the creation and annihilation of dislocations. Such a scheme becomes unwieldy when considering the large numbers of dislocations involved in common crystal plasticity. In 1970, Kröner (“Initial Studies of a Plasticity Theory Based Upon Statistical Mechanics 
,” Inelastic Behaviors of Solids (Materials Sciences and Engineering), M. F. Kanninen et al., eds., McGraw-Hill, New York, pp. 137–147), a pioneer in the continuum representation of dislocations, proposed a statistical method using n-point correlations to classify the dislocated state in a compact form. In addition to providing a convenient form, the correlations naturally identify dipoles, multipoles, and other higher order structures, such as cells, networks, and braids. As formulated, Kröner’s method would require high-resolution microscopy techniques, which limits its utility for experimental measurements. The current work presents a modification to Kröner’s method that would allow it to be used within the currently available resolution limits of bulk microscopy. Furthermore, in this work, newly developed microscopy techniques are employed to refine those resolution limits to more significant levels. The high-resolution bulk dislocation characterization is applied to a well-annealed nickel specimen and the results including visualizations of mesoscale structures are presented.},

	abstract = {Grain size refinement is an important strengthening mechanism in Al-Mg 5000 series alloys, which have a relatively large Hall-Petch slope compared with other Al alloys. In addition, the high work hardening rate exhibited by Al-Mg alloys provides excellent formability. This paper investigates the influence of grain size on the flow stress over a range of strains, and in several different Al-Mg alloys. It is found that the Hall-Petch slope decreases after yield, indicating that the large grain size effect is primarily associated with initiating plasticity in these alloys. Beyond yield the slope decreases to a value equivalent to other, non-Mg containing alloys, and shows no clear dependence on strain. The intercept stress from the Hall-Petch plots at different strains is non-linear with ε 1/2 for alloys containing up to 3 wt-\%Mg, which indicates that the free slip distance is strain dependent in these alloys. In an Al-5 wt-\%Mg alloy the intercept stress is linear with ε 1/2, indicating that solute atoms are controlling the free slip distance. If Mn is added to the Al-5 wt-\%Mg alloy, as it is in commercial alloys, it has little influence on the grain size dependence, but it does increase the frictional stress at the highest Mn level of 0.7 wt-\%.},

	abstract = {This paper describes the response of a precipitate microstructure to various types of non-isothermal temperature changes, namely reversion, ramp heating and thermal cycles, met in heat-affected zones (HAZs) of arc-welds, in an Al–Zn–Mg alloy in the T6 and T7 states. During these thermal histories, the precipitate size and volume fraction are quantitatively measured by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). Reversion experiments are characterised by a fast dissolution stage at almost constant average precipitate size, followed by a coarsening stage that affects the surviving precipitates. Ramp heating experiments show a dissolution behaviour, which is temporarily interrupted for low heating rates, either due to phase transition when the initial precipitates are of a metastable nature (the case of T6 initial state), or due to a dynamic competition between the average and critical radii during the temperature increase (the case of the T7 material). The HAZ of arc-welds is characterised by a gradual increase of the dissolved precipitate fraction as one gets closer to the weld line. In the zone immediately before complete dissolution, precipitate coarsening is observed.

A simple model, based on the growth/dissolution of precipitates distributed in size classes, has been adapted to the present ternary alloy. This model, calibrated using the reversion experiments, has proven its predictive nature in all the other thermal cycles investigated (ramp heating and welding). The predictions of the model are used in order to improve the physical insight into the range of material behaviour observed in the experiments.},

In this study a model Al–2.8 wt.\% Mg–0.16 wt.\% Sc alloy has been chosen for examination since precipitation involves simple spherical precipitates, the absence of metastable phases and the solid solution effect is dominated by the magnesium content. Using a previously development precipitation model, it has been possible to develop an integrated yield stress/work hardening model in which the shearable/non-shearable transition and the size distribution of precipitates are explicitly accounted for. The agreement between the model and the experiments is excellent and the shearable/non-shearable transition radius is consistent with experimental observations.},

	abstract = {A microstructure model to predict the mechanical properties during annealing has been
developed for two important classifications of industrial processed automotive alloys:
aluminum-magnesium AA5754 alloy and boron-containing interstitial free steel. The
model adopts a rule of mixture to capture the overall softening due to recovery and
recrystallization based on the assumption that these two processes proceed
independently. The internal state variable approach is employed in the mathematical
formulation of the model. The Kuhlmann and Cottrell/Aytekin recovery model and the
JMAK recrystallization model are used to capture the time evolution of dislocation
density and fraction recrystallized, respectively. The required kinetic parameters are
determined from isothermal tests. Isothermal annealing models are developed and
validated against data obtained from continuous heating experiments. Experimentally,
tensile and hardness tests are carried out in conjunction with quantitative
metallography to quantify the kinetics of recovery and recrystallization.
The model accurately predicts the microstructural and yield stress evolution in AA5754
under isothermal and non-isothermal annealing conditions. For IF-boron steel,
however, the current modelling approach is too simple to capture the complexity
involved in the recrystallization process. Consequently, the model for IF-boron steel is
considered as purely empirical in nature.},

The main established Aluminium alloys and their application in automotive parts are presented together with recent developments. Also new studies and innovative multi-material concepts are discussed where Aluminium light-weight solutions are compared with that of other materials, like new steels, magnesium, plastics and composites. In the “SLC” (Super-Light-Car) project these new concepts were tested in a multi-material body-in-white prototype for a VW Golf V car, reaching a 34\% weight reduction within a cost increment of 7,8 €/kg saved, with suitable technologies for high volume assembly cycles. In the final SLC concept Aluminium is the material of choice, proving its leading role in innovative light-weighting of cars. Aluminium achieves weight savings of parts up to 50\% while maintaining safety and performance in a cost efficient way, competing efficiently with other light-weight materials.},

	abstract = {Although the use of aluminum in cars has been increasing for the past two decades, progress has been limited in developing aluminum auto bodies. In fact, most aluminum substitution has come in the form of castings and forgings in the transmission, wheels, etc. Car manufacturers have developed all-aluminum cars with two competing designs: conventional unibody and the spaceframe. However, aluminum is far from being a material of choice for auto bodies. The substitution of aluminum for steel is partly influenced by regulatory pressures to meet fuel efficiency standards by reducing vehicle weight, and to meet recycling standards. The key obstacles are the high cost of primary aluminum as compared to steel and added fabrication costs of aluminum panels. Both the aluminum and the automotive industries have attempted to make aluminum a cost-effective alternative to steel. This paper analyzes the cost of fabrication and assembly of four different aluminum car body designs, making comparisons with conventional steel designs at current aluminum prices and using current aluminum fabrication technology. It then attempts to determine if aluminum can be an alternative to steel at lower primary aluminum prices, and improved fabrication processes.},

Length (λ), diameter (d) and number density (NP) per unit volume of the needle-shaped precipitates were measured on TEM micrographs.

High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) was the primary method of investigation. Within the 4–16 h aging interval, nanometer scale, homogeneously dispersed, coherent, lath-like particles were detected in the matrix. The orientation of the lath particles in the matrix is such that the edges are aligned along the 〈1 0 0〉Al directions. From the Fourier transformation of the HRTEM images obtained on 〈1 0 0〉Al zones, it was possible to confirm that two variants give rise to diffraction spots that were previously associated with the presence of S″-phase in “Cu lean” Al–Mg–Cu alloys. Two other variants give rise to streaked diffraction spots positioned around the (1 1 0)Al. The detected particles are termed GPBII in this study, instead of previously suggested S″-phase notation. The findings of this study are also compared with those of the frequently studied “Cu rich” Al–Cu–Mg alloying system.},

	abstract = {Explanations are presented for the origins of hardening in the artificially aged alloys Al1.1Cu1.7Mg(0.1Ag) (at.\%), which differ from those hitherto accepted. These and other compositions which lie within the α + S phase field of the AlCuMg phase diagram, are known to harden in two stages separated by a distinct, and often prolonged hardness plateau. The first stage, which occurs very rapidly (e.g. within 60 s at 150°C) and may contribute as much as 70\% of the total hardening in both alloys, is now attributed to solute clustering rather than to the formation of GPB zones. This phenomenon has been termed cluster hardening. GPB zones were not detected in the ternary AlCuMg alloy until later in the ageing process and they are considered to be the source of the second stage of hardening. The identity of another phase, which nucleates and grows as laths on dislocation lines early in the ageing process of the ternary alloy, was confirmed as the equilibrium phase S. Contrary to what is generally believed, precipitation of this phase is not considered to have a significant effect on either stage of hardening. In the Ag-containing alloy, the second stage of hardening occurs much more rapidly and is attributed to the presence of GPB zones, plates of the hexagonal phase X′ and finely dispersed particles of the S phase, which seem to form from GPB zones. This X′ phase, which is uniformly dispersed and nucleates at the sites of co-clusters of MgAg atoms, appears to have a composition close to that of the S phase (i.e. Al2CuMg), although it also contains significant amounts of Ag.},

Al-Mg-Sc alloy in the presence of A1₃Sc precipitates was investigated. Recovered
microstructures containing A1₃Sc precipitates were obtained through a series of thermo-mechanical treatments including pre-aging, cold rolling and annealing.
Recovered microstructures were characterized in terms of precipitate size distribution,
subgrain sizes and dislocation structures. Yield strength and work hardening of
processed microstructures were examined by tensile testing at 77K. The results show that
the effect of precipitates arises directly from precipitation strengthening as well as
indirectly from their effectiveness at controlling the recovered microstructure. Physical based models were developed to describe the tensile response of recovered
microstructures consistent with previous models on single phase recovered Al-Mg alloys. For the first time, the impact of precipitates on recovery kinetics was
captured by coupling recovery models of single phase Al-Mg alloys and creep models.
In this new modelling approach a transition stage from dislocation annihilation to a climb controlled mechanism was defined. In addition, the effects of both recovery and
precipitates on work hardening have been incorporated in the previous models. Finally,
model limitations as well as their potential applications to improve mechanical properties
including yield strength, ultimate tensile strength and uniform elongation of Al-Mg-Sc
alloys by controlling thermo-mechanical processing and chemical composition were
revisited.},

The distinguishing feature of the microstructures of 2xxx, 6xxx and 7xxx series aluminium alloys, used extensively by the automotive and aerospace industries, is that they contain a distribution of precipitates. The mechanical properties of these alloys are largely controlled by the nature of the interactions between dislocations and precipitates and therefore tailoring the precipitate distribution is one of the methods to improve the engineering performance. In this chapter, an outline of the current state-of-the-art in describing quantitatively (modeling) precipitation processes in Al alloys is presented. Emphasis is placed on the effects of time and temperature, but the role of alloy chemistry, precipitate shape and the role of plastic deformation are also introduced. The advantages and disadvantages of the different modeling approaches are outlined.},

The nucleation rateJ is expressed in terms of the dislocation density π, the free energy of formation of the critical embryo δG d * and other quantities. It is found that the nucleation barrier δG d * is only slightly shape dependent and therefore the critical shape can be approximated by that of the family with the lowest nucleation barrier. Then δG d * andJ are calculated numerically for incoherent nucleation along edge and screw dislocations. It is found that: i) the nucleation barrier is smaller for edge than for screw dislocations, ii) the higher the shear modulus, the stronger the catalytic effect of dislocations, iii) metastable embryos may exist in undersaturated systems.},

Recent progress in understanding the statistics of dislocation-precipitate interactions is highlighted. It is shown that Pythagorean superposition for strengthening by random mixtures of localized obstacles of different strengths is rigorously obeyed in the limit of very weak obstacles; this had been known previously as a result of computer simulation experiments. Some experimental data are discussed in light of this prediction. All of the currently viable mechanisms of precipitation hardening are reviewed. It is demonstrated that all versions of the theory of coherency hardening are woefully inadequate, while the theory of order hardening is capable of accurately predicting the contribution of γ′ precipitates to the CRSS of aged Ni-Al alloys. It is also convincingly shown that a new theory based on computer simulation experiments of the motion of dislocations through arrays of obstacles having a finite range of interaction cannot explain these same data, and is of doubtful validity in other instances for which its success has been proclaimed. A new theory of hardening by spinodal decomposition is proposed. It is based on the statistics of interaction between dislocations and diffuse attractive obstacles, and is shown to be in very good quantitative agreement with much of the limited data available. Some of the problems that remain to be addressed and solved are discussed.},

The authors have agreed that recrystallization is theformation of a new grain structure in a deformed material by the formation and migration of high angle grain boundaries driven by the stored energy of deformation. High angle grain boundaries are those with greater than a 10 to 15° misorientation. Recovery can be defined as all annealing processes occurring in deformed materials that occur without the migration of a high angle grain boundary. Grain coarsening can in turn, be defined as processes involving the migration of grain boundaries when the driving force for migration is solely the reduction of the grain boundary area itself. These definitions are consistent with some earlier definitions.},

	abstract = {Recovery of mechanical properties during annealing of deformed metals has been modelled based on a microstructural representation comprising two elements, (i) the cell/subgrain structure (size δ) and (ii) the dislocation density (ρ) within the subgrains. These two microstructural elements are treated as independent internal state variables and the recovery of flow stress obtained by adding the time dependent contributions due to subgrain growth [σ ∝ 1/δ(t)] and dislocation network growth . The growth of a dislocation network has been treated in terms of thermally activated glide, thermally activated cross-slip, climb and solute drag as rate-controlling mechanisms. Subgrain growth has been analysed in a manner analogous to normal grain growth, with climb of the boundary dislocations being the rate controlling mechanism. The model has successfully been applied in the interpretations of recovery observations in iron, aluminium and AlMg alloys. It follows from the theoretical treatment as well as from the analysis of experimental data that the characteristic logarithmic time dependence of low temperature recovery is the result of a reaction controlled either by thermally activated glide of jogged screw dislocations or by solute drag. It has been demonstrated that a mechanism based on thermally activated cross-slip does not apply in this context.},

	abstract = {The deformation and fracture of Al-Mg alloys have been investigated over a range of strain rates and temperatures. The rate and temperature-dependence of the deformation can be understood on the basis of the mobility of Mg atoms. When the Mg atoms can diffuse at a sufficient rate they interact with dislocations to produce serrated yielding and a zero or negative strain rate sensitivity. This greatly restricts the tensile ductility. Outside of this serrated flow regime enhanced ductilities are achieved due to the positive strain rate sensitivity stabilizing any inhomogeneities which develop. However, the final fracture is also influenced by the constituent particle concentration. Voiding occurs at particles and if the concentration of particles is sufficiently large the voids link up by local shear. Decreasing the constituent particle concentration, together with a reduction in the amplitude of serrations, results in larger tensile ductilities. At high temperatures, quite large strain rate sensitivities can be achieved but the ductility is finally limited by the propensity for voiding in these alloys.},

The inherent characteristic of the crystal structure of the S phase, i.e. the symmetry of the pentagonal subunit, was considered to be the fundamental factor determining the preference of the variant pair. By using high angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy tomography, we successively obtained the 3D reconstruction of the S precipitates at these defects. Both the morphology of an individual S precipitate and the overall configuration of the S precipitates nucleated at these defects can be clearly observed without misunderstandings induced by the overlap and projection effects of the conventional two-dimensional methods.},

Using quantitative high resolution electron microscopy, four models for the crystal structure of the S-phase (Al2CuMg) in Al-based alloys are critically evaluated, and a new model is proposed. This model is identical to that of Perlitz and Westgren, but with an exchange of Cu and Mg. Two distinct precipitate morphologies are observed. Both are laths elongated along 〈100〉 directions common to the matrix and the precipitate and lie on \{021\} planes of the matrix. Type I precipitates have interfaces of the type (021)Al‖(001)S while type II precipitates have interfaces of the type (021)Al‖(043)S, i.e. the two types differ in the S-phase lattice plane that is conjugate to the \{021\}Al habit plane. The interface plane of type I precipitates tends to be atomically flat containing only growth ledges while that of type II precipitates is stepped. The orientation relationship of the two types of precipitate differs by a rotation of about 5° around the lath axis. The difference between the two types of precipitate is discussed in terms of their lattice correspondence, and type II precipitates are shown to follow an invariant line strain. Moiré analysis of lattice distortions revealed that \{020\}Al planes remain undistorted while \{002\}Al planes suffer significant shear during S-phase nucleation.},

The most favorable combination of two S variants is observed to be variants 1 and 4 (or variants 2 and 3), and the variant selection criterion for S precipitate with the classic orientation relationship is proved to be that the dislocation line direction lies in the habit plane of the precipitate. The contribution of S precipitate groups to strengthening is evaluated by comparing the difference in total system energy increment induced by precipitate loop and the equivalent number of Guinier–Preston–Bagaryatsky zones and discrete S particles during plastic deformation. The results show that the average size of the precipitate loops as well as other kinds of precipitate groups has an important influence on the final strengthening effect.

The vacancy denuded zone between colonies of prismatic dislocation loops and grain boundaries is one good example where the critical supersaturation can occur.

A high stress is associated with the precipitates, which can be relaxed by the punching out of rows of prismatic dislocation loops. This has been observed directly in the electron microscope. A comparison of the experimental results with the theory of Bullough and Newman enables the critical shear stress for prismatic glide to be estimated. The value obtained is 3.4 × 10−4G.

The results have been interpreted in a very consistent way based on the following points: 1.
(1) a strong binding energy exists between Mg atoms and vacancies in the ternary alloy so that all vacancies are coupled to Mg atoms;
2.
(2) Mg-vacancy couples can move easily at room temperature so that diffusion of Zn atoms in the ternary alloy occurs via Mg-vacancy couples.

In order to get an insight into the precipitation processes during processing of Al-Mg type alloys, some samples were solution treated at 535°C/1 h, and some of them were recrystallization annealed at 320°÷350°C/3 h. After that all the samples were treated in a same manner: cold rolling to 50–60\% and final annealing at temperatures in the range of 220°÷470°C/3 h. It was supposed that the structure of samples pre-treated by recrystallization annealing at 320°/350°C is characterized with S type (Al2MgCu) phases in the Al-Mg-(Mn)-Cu alloys and with β′/β (Mg5Al8) phases in the Al-Mg-Mn alloys. These structure features are rather unchangeable during the subsequent cold rolling and annealing treatments in the temperature range of 220°÷320°C. During annealing at higher temperatures (such as 470°C) precipitation of Mn-bearing particles (MnAl6 or (Fe,Mn)Al6) might occur in both type of alloys. After solution treatment at 535°C most of the alloying elements are dissolved into solid solution, thus inducing a high potential for precipitation processes during annealing at 220°÷470°C. The cold deformation was found to contribute the electrical resistivity intensively at the beginning of deformation (in the range up to ∼20\%), and it was not influenced by the chemical composition of tested alloys.

This qualitatively justifies the theoretical prediction by Larché on coherent heterogeneous nucleation on edge dislocations. Following the evaluation of the volume free energy change for the binary system by the ideal solution model and the mean-field model by Khachaturyan, the nucleation barrier and the nucleation rate were calculated and compared with experimentally determined data based on Larché's model. Specifically, the back-calculated interfacial energies from the experimentally determined nucleation rate data are in good agreement with the interfacial energy temperature dependence predicted by the related interfacial energy model. The effects of misfit strain, volume diffusion, interfacial energy, and nucleation sites are discussed.},

	abstract = {This paper concentrates on the superplastic response of fine-grained and coarse-grained Al–Mg alloys under uniaxial tension. To identify the main characteristics of superplastic deformation and to determine the optimum deformation parameters, the microstructure and dislocation substructure of the alloys are analyzed as a function of strain, strain rate and temperature using electron backscatter diffraction and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Under optimum deformation conditions of temperature and strain rate, these Al–Mg alloys have an elongation to failure in excess of 300\%. Dynamic recrystallization is dominant at strain rates in excess of 10−1 s−1 and results in a strong coarsening of the microstructure and premature failure. Dynamic recovery prevails at a strain rate of around 10−2 s−1, leading to great enhancement of the plasticity of the coarse-grained materials. TEM observations show that subgrain formation proceeds slowly. During initial straining, subgrains are formed primarily along the original grain boundaries. This results in a “core and mantle” microstructure, with dynamic recovery mainly taking place in the mantle region. A uniform substructure is established at a strain of the order of 1.},

The effect of prestraining depends significantly on the parameters of the thermomechanical treatment, and has to be considered in terms of competition between homogeneous precipitation and heterogeneous precipitation on dislocations. The effect of prestraining on peak hardening is controlled by the nucleation of the hardening η′ phase, and therefore depends critically on the heating rate to the ageing temperature. The effect of prestraining on overageing is an increase in overall coarsening kinetics due to the combination of faster precipitate coarsening on dislocations and dissolution of homogeneous precipitates followed by solute diffusion towards dislocations.},

Al-Mg-Sc alloy in the presence of A1₃Sc precipitates was investigated. Recovered
microstructures containing A1₃Sc precipitates were obtained through a series of thermo-mechanical treatments including pre-aging, cold rolling and annealing.
Recovered microstructures were characterized in terms of precipitate size distribution,
subgrain sizes and dislocation structures. Yield strength and work hardening of
processed microstructures were examined by tensile testing at 77K. The results show that
the effect of precipitates arises directly from precipitation strengthening as well as
indirectly from their effectiveness at controlling the recovered microstructure. Physical based models were developed to describe the tensile response of recovered
microstructures consistent with previous models on single phase recovered Al-Mg alloys. For the first time, the impact of precipitates on recovery kinetics was
captured by coupling recovery models of single phase Al-Mg alloys and creep models.
In this new modelling approach a transition stage from dislocation annihilation to a climb controlled mechanism was defined. In addition, the effects of both recovery and
precipitates on work hardening have been incorporated in the previous models. Finally,
model limitations as well as their potential applications to improve mechanical properties
including yield strength, ultimate tensile strength and uniform elongation of Al-Mg-Sc
alloys by controlling thermo-mechanical processing and chemical composition were
revisited.},

treated material was determined using isothermal calorimetry in the temperature range of 160-

precipitation through a set of differential scanning calorimetry experiments. A new model was
proposed to describe the kinetics of concurrent precipitation and dissolution of natural aging
zones during artificial aging of the naturally aged materials. The kinetics for the formation of
natural aging zones was also modeled. A new process model was developed to predict the yield
strength of the alloy during the entire aging process. The validity of the model was verified by
the excellent agreement between the predictions of the model and independent experimental
results.},

	url = {http://circle.ubc.ca/handle/2429/44186},
	abstract = {The effect of high temperature extrusion conditions on the microstructure of AA3003 aluminum alloys has been investigated. The extrusion trials were conducted using a laboratory scale fully instrumented extrusion press at Rio Tinto Alcan’s Arvida Research and Development Centre (ARDC). Direct Chill (DC) cast billets were homogenized using one of three different treatments (e.g. 8 h at 500°C, 8h at 550°C, and 24 h at 600°C) prior to extrusion. Extrusions were conducted using a range of extrusion temperatures (e.g. 350°C to 500°C), ram speeds (e.g. 2 mm/s to 32 mm/s), and extrusion ratios (e.g. 17:1 ER to 280:1 ER). This provided a full range of as-extruded microstructures from recrystallized to unrecrystallized, with a wide range of final grain sizes.
The microstructure of the extrudates was examined using optical microscopy and Electron Backscatter Microscopy (EBSD). The extrudate microstructures have been rationalized in comparison with the processing conditions from the extrusion trails. It was found that the extent of recrystallization is related to the homogenization treatment (i.e. dispersoid number density), and the ram speed (i.e. the temperature profile). It was also found that the ‘unrecrystallized’ deformed grain thickness could be approximated using a simple mass balance approach. The stability of ‘unrecrystallized’ as-extruded samples was investigated in post-extrusion annealing experiments, using a range of temperatures (e.g. 500°C to 550°C) and times (e.g. 10 min. at 550°C). It was found that most of the structures had enough stored energy to recrystallize.
In addition, high temperature compression tests were conducted using a Gleeble® 3500 Thermo-mechanical Simulator. These tests were conducted to further investigate the constituent behavior of the aluminum alloy with regards to transient strain rates. Tests were conducted at a temperature of 500°C using a constant strain of 1 s-¹ and 10 s-¹, and transient strain rates. The yield stress, flow stress and work hardening were fit to a physically based flow stress model developed by Kocks and Chen. It was found that the strain rate history had an effect on the flow stress of the material, and that the model could not fully capture the behavior.},

	abstract = {AA5xxx series Al alloys have presented great potential in recent decades for packaging and automotive applications. A recent further development of these alloys has been the addition of Sc and Zr. The presence of these elements is known to develop strengthening phases that also influence other metallurgical phenomena such as recovery and recrystallization. However, the low solubility of both Sc and Zr in Al requires high cooling rates during casting in order to attain a supersaturated solid solution which conventional DC casting is unable to achieve.
In this study, two Al- 3\%Mg alloys, one Sc-free and the other containing 0.4\% Sc were cast using the Flexcaster® available at the Novelis Global Technology Center (Kingston, Ontario). The Flexcaster® is a strip casting technology that transforms liquid aluminum into a directly rollable cast ingot that is not subject to scalping or homogenization processing. This technology is characterized by relatively high solidification and cooling rates. 
Aging experiments were performed on as-cast and cold-rolled samples of the two alloys to study the evolution of strengthening phases and their impact on recovery and recrystallization. Both alloys were artificially aged following casting at 200, 300 and 400°C for times ranging from 30s to 72 hours. The alloys were characterized by hardness and tensile tests and electrical resistivity measurements as well as optical and electron microscopy in order to monitor the aging behavior of the alloys. 
Results show enhanced strengthening in the Sc-containing alloy and superior high temperature microstructural stability in comparison to the Sc-free alloy as well as conventionally cast AlMgSc alloys.},

	abstract = {The early stages of pre-aging at near room temperature in an Al–Zn–Mg–Cu based commercial alloy were studied by electrical resistivity. The resistivity changes can be adequately described in the same terms of a Johnson–Mehl–Avrami (JMA) type function for the volume fraction growth of the Guinier–Preston zones or pre-precipitate solute clusters formed. For one specific case, resistivity results were correlated with those obtained using synchrotron-radiation small-angle X-ray scattering (SR-SAXS). Based on the analysis of the parameters of the JMA equation, the existence of a complex diffusion process during pre-precipitation is deduced. An apparent activation energy of 0.69±0.04 eV for the formation of the above mentioned particles is found. From this energy value, the migration of Mg-vacancy complexes is identified as the main microstructural mechanism responsible for the pre-precipitation.},

It was found that over extended periods of time, the resistivity increases linearly with the logarithm of time. More importantly, three clear stages of clustering were observed during natural ageing. The possible origin of these three distinct stages was briefly discussed. As well, the activation energy of clustering during the second stage was calculated using the cross-cut technique. The measured value was relatively close to the migration energies of vacancies and solute atoms (Mg/Si) which suggested an important role of them in the clustering process. Finally it was found that the solution treatment temperature does not have a significant effect on the mechanism of clustering.},

The apparently homogeneous nucleation of precipitates within the grains has been shown to be largely controlled by the concentration and distribution of vacant lattice sites. A semiquantitative theory has been developed for the formation of precipitate free zones at grain boundaries and the results have been used to develop a model of nucleation by vacancy/solute atom clusters. The most important feature of the model is that the dispersion of precipitates is very sensitive to quench procedure and the very early stages of ageing. It is thought that the results may be useful in the explanation of quench sensitivity, delay time before ageing, rate of heating to the ageing temperature and trace element effects in alloys.},

Using the 3DAP results, the precipitate size distributions for these ageing conditions were determined in terms of the measured number of solute atoms per precipitate. The number density and the Cu content of the precipitates decreased with increasing temperature, whereas the Mg/Si ratio increased. The size distribution of precipitates at the higher ageing temperatures showed the addition of larger size precipitates to the precipitate population. A modification to Matthiessen's law was employed to describe the anomalous resistivity increase by considering the effect of solutes and precipitates on the resistivity evolution. Using the 3DAP results in analysing the resistivity anomaly, it was found that the decrease in the resistivity maxima with increasing temperature was associated with the decrease in the number density of precipitates and not the scattering power of precipitates. The 3DAP results were further used to provide information on the mechanisms of early-stage decomposition and the temperature dependence of the nucleation rate. From this, the nucleation rate appeared to be controlled by the migration of solute atoms, which was assisted by quenched-in vacancies.},

Strain rate sensitivity measurements suggest that deformation of high-purity Al is governed by dislocation–dislocation interactions in a broad range of temperatures, whereas Al alloys exhibit a larger thermal component of flow stress due to the presence of solute atoms in the matrix. The electrical resistivity data provide information about the evolution of both the dislocation density and the dislocation mean free path and establish the contributions of dislocation storage and dynamic recovery during plastic flow of materials at 4.2 K. The results suggest that fracture is initiated by the collapse of the dislocation network at places where dislocations develop a critical spacing for spontaneous annihilation.

The microstructure of the CG alloy compressed at 298 K was characterized by well-developed dislocation cells and microbands embedded into those cells, but ill-defined dislocation cells were formed at 77 K. The UFG alloy exhibited the elastic-near perfect plastic behavior at both temperatures. The dislocation cell formation was unlikely to occur in the UFG alloy. Instead, localized shear bands were formed at the onset of plastic deformation at both temperatures as an alternative strain accommodation process. Therefore, the elastic-near perfect plastic behavior of the UFG alloy could be explained by the deformation mode change from the uniform mode associated with the cell formation to the localized mode associated with the shear band formation as the grain size was refined to the UFG regime.},

In order to consider the effect of flow stress and its dependence on temperature, strain and strain rate, a neural network model is also employed in the analysis. Based on the performed tensile tests, two different neural network models are constructed one for smooth yielding and the other one for the serrated flow. Then, the ANN models are coupled with the thermo-mechanical analysis. In the next step, by combination of the predicted temperature, strain and strain rates fields and the experimental data achieved from the tensile tests, the occurence of dynamic strain ageing during hot rolling is predicted.

A previous study (Ratchev et al., Mater. Sci. Eng. A222 (1997) 189) on the hot ductility of these materials was further extended to include the role of dislocation cell formation and recovery. TEM investigations have shown that after hot torsion some of the elongated grains contained a dislocation cell structure. An average of four such cells (in one dimension) may correspond to a small-equiaxed grain visible (with relatively sharp contrast) under polarized light optical microscopy. Development of long-range misorientations in the cell-forming regions is suggested to be the mechanism for their easy optical visibility. Much higher dislocation density and total absence of high angle boundaries in the cell-forming regions rule out possibilities of dynamic recrystallization. Decreased cell size and increased cell misorientation (both local and long range) were observed with increasing strain. This in turn may indicate a combination of deformation/recovery as the formation mechanism. Observed higher recoverability in the material with larger interparticle spacings may inhibit the formation of plastic instabilities or strain localizations (Hughes, Acta Metall. Mater. 41(5) (1993) 1421; Kuhlmann-Wilsdorf, Mater Sci. Eng. A113 (1989) 1; Wagner et al., Acta Metall. Mater. 43(10) (1995) 3799; Gil Sevillano et al., Prog. Mater.

Experimental results of Nemat-Nasser et al. [Acta Mater. 47 (1999) 3705; Scripta Mater. 40 (1999) 859] suggest that molybdenum behaves plastically differently at high and low strain rates. Within the framework of the classical theory of thermally activated dislocation motion, different models and model parameters must be used for high and low strain-rate deformations, indicating that different rate-controlling deformation mechanisms may be involved. In the present paper, a unified constitutive description of the mechanical behavior of molybdenum is developed. The activation energy and the maximum strength of the local barriers to the dislocation motion, change gradually with the changing strain-rate and temperature, due to the increased solute mobility with increasing temperature. Therefore, no change in the deformation mechanism is actually included. Only the configuration of the local obstacles is assumed to change because of the change in the solute mobility. The model predictions are in good agreement with the experimental results.},

One set of tests have been used for model calibration and another more complex set of tests for its validation. The model is based on a coupled set of evolution equations for dislocation density and (mono) vacancy concentration. Furthermore, it includes the effect of diffusing solutes in order to describe dynamic strain ageing (DSA). The model described the overall flow stress evolution well with exception of the details of the effect of the DSA phenomenon. Its numerical solution is implemented in a format suitable for large-scale finite element simulations.},

The monovacancy migration energies derived from annealing experiments after both quenching and irradiation are in fair agreement. Also, the sum of the monovacancy migration energy and the formation energy is in reasonable agreement with the activation energy for self-diffusion due to monovacancies. The temperature of Stage III annealing after irradiation is generally lower then the annealing temperature after quenching because of a smaller number of defect jumps to annihilation after irradiation. Information about divacancies and trivacancies is considerably more limited and is critically reviewed.},

Monte Carlo simulation is a most powerful method to examine such microscopic events occurring in alloys during phase transformations. The present work aims to investigate the effects of various additional elements to an Al–Cu alloy from both viewpoints of the nucleation and growth behavior of GP zones. Comparisons between the quantitative kinetics determined by the electrical resistivity changes and the microstructural evolution obtained from the simulation provide useful information on both the macroscopic transformation behavior and the detailed formation mechanism of Cu clusters. As is well known so far, addition of Zn or Ag exerts no marked influence on the GP zone formation, whereas addition of Sn or Zr markedly retards the growth rate of GP zones. As for a small addition of Mg, however, slightly complicated effects are revealed; i.e. a characteristic nucleation behavior and a suppressed growth of GP zones. This is well explained in terms of both the extremely increased number density of Mg/Cu/Vacancy complexes and the pronounced decrease in free-vacancies available for Cu diffusion due to the preferential vacancy trapping by Mg atoms. Such situations are directly observed in atom configurations during the simulation.},

	abstract = {Plastic deformation may affect bulk diffusion by altering the rates of point defect production and annihilation. In the present work (Part I) a detailed analysis of this phenomenon is given with particular emphasis upon possible upper limits for the magnitude of the effect at elevated diffusion temperatures where bulk diffusion occurs over macroscopic distances. In order to consider all possibilities from this point of view the following three models are analyzed: model I—vacancies may be created or destroyed at jogs on gliding screw dislocations and climbing edge dislocations. These possible vacancy sources and sinks are intermixed within crystal subgrains and the net source or sink action is zero over representative subgrain volumes; model II—a net vacancy source (or sink) action is required within the subgrains in order to support the required nonconservative dislocation motion. The required excess vacancies are destroyed (created) at the subgrain boundaries where the concentration is maintained in equilibrium; model III—large numbers of vacancies are readily created everywhere during deformation but are destroyed everywhere in the specimen volume only with difficulty. It is concluded that model I is probably the most realistic. In this case, upper limits are obtained for the required defect production and destruction at dislocations, and it is found that the required defects can be obtained from rather small perturbations of the usual thermally generated fluxes in detailed balance at the jogs. At practical diffusion temperatures and strain rates of the effects of the deformation on bulk diffusion are, therefore, very small and are below the limits of detection by usual methods. Model II appears to be conceivable under certain conditions. Analysis of this case indicates that the effects of deformation are larger than in model I because of the longer range vacancydiffusion which is required. However, the effects are still small under usual conditions. Model III is purely phenomenological and is included since it has been used by others. Several characteristics of this model which may be used to set limitations on possible enhancements obtainable in this model are derived. In addition to the analysis of the above three models, detailed discussion is given of the following aspects of the diffusion—deformation problem: (1) effect of surface vacancy sinks on diffusion—deformation experiments carried out near a free surface; (2) diffusion enhancement expressed in terms of the number of excess vacancy jumps; (3) temperature dependence of the diffusional effects of deformation; (4) mechanical work required to maintain nonequilibrium vacancy concentrations; (5) the relationship between macroscopic creep behavior and nonequilibrium vacancies; (6) the possibilities of interstitial production. Many of the results established here are employed in Part III [J. Appl. Phys. (to be published)] where a comprehensive interpretation of recent experimental work in this field is carried out. Part II [J. Appl. Phys. (to be published)] consists of an analysis of strain‐enhanced diffusion due to short‐circuiting along static and moving dislocations and grain boundaries.},

This quasi-continuum approach suggests that the system is not partitioned into transformed and untransformed regions but the order parameter proceeds towards equilibrium uniformly in all microvolumes of the system. However, defect-mediated diffusion (vacancy mechanism) involving local atomic jump processes during the early stages of transformation kinetics can produce discrete regions within which the order parameter has changed significantly embedded in an unperturbed matrix. An estimate of this ‘graininess’ is calculated in terms of vacancy diffusion parameters which allows us to distinguish between heterogeneous and homogeneous regimes of transformation processes in the alloy.},

	abstract = {The aim of this chapter is to discuss the deformed state. The most important of the many changes associated with recrystallization and other annealing phenomena is the decrease in the density of dislocations. This chapter is concerned with dislocation accumulation rather than dislocation loss and increases in stored energy that are a result of deformation. The dislocations provide the driving force for the annealing phenomena. During deformation the microstructure of a metal changes in several ways. The first and the most obvious is that grains change their shape and there is a large increase in the total grain boundary area. The new grain boundary area has to be created during deformation and this is done by the incorporation of some of the dislocations that are continuously created during the deformation process. Another variation is the appearance of an internal structure within the grains. This, too, results from the accumulation of dislocations. The sum of the energy of all of the dislocations and new interfaces represents the stored energy of deformation. During deformation the orientations of single crystals and of the individual grains of a polycrystalline metal change relative to the direction of the applied stress.},

Using isothermal annealing tests, recovery and recrystallisation kinetics were quantified as a function of temperature and cold reduction. The model was formulated employing the internal state variable approach with the following three state variables: dislocation density, volume fraction recrystallised, and grain size. A rule of mixtures is adopted to separate the effect of recovery and recrystallisation in the overall softening. Model validation has been carried out by comparing the predicted softening curves with those obtained in continuous heating tests replicating heating rates of industrial continuous annealing lines. The model can be applied to non-isothermal processing routes of industrial cold rolled AA 5754 with thickness reduction in the range 40-80\%.},

	abstract = {We have investigated the influence of plastic deformation on the precipitation kinetics of the S′(S) phase in the AA2024 aluminium alloy, with the objective of understanding the microstructures found in friction stir welds of the same alloy. Different types of thermo-mechanical treatments have been investigated, where plastic deformation has been carried out either before heating in a salt bath, or concurrently with the thermal treatment in a Gleeble compression apparatus. The volume fraction of precipitates has been measured by differential scanning calorimetry and the precipitate morphology has been observed by transmission electron microscopy.
It is observed that plastic deformation increases the precipitation kinetics in the temperature range below 300 °C. This can be attributed both to the increase in the number of nucleation sites and to the increase in the effective diffusion coefficient. At higher temperatures the influence of plasticity on the volume fraction is negligible, however, in the presence of deformation during the heat treatment, the precipitate morphology is profoundly modified. The effect of plastic deformation is observed to be similar, whether plastic deformation is carried out before or during the heat treatment.
These results are shown to be valuable tools in understanding the microstructures of friction stir welds of the same material. It is shown that taking into account the effect of plastic deformation is not absolutely necessary in the thermo-mechanically affected zone. However, we show that the precipitate microstructure in some parts of the heat-affected zone is strongly influenced by a small amount of plasticity.},

	abstract = {Due to their interaction with crystalline defects, solute atoms play a critical role in the microstructure evolution of aluminum alloys during deformation. In addition, deformed structures often exhibit a modified aging response. For a better understanding of these mechanisms, we provide here a thorough study of deformation-induced segregation and precipitation mechanisms in an aluminum alloy containing 5.8 wt.\% Mg subjected to severe plastic deformation (SPD). The solutionized alloy was processed by high-pressure torsion at room temperature and at 200 °C. The investigation of the microstructure and of the distribution of Mg after deformation by scanning transmission electron microscopy and atom probe tomography revealed that clustering and segregations occurred during severe deformation. Mg atoms agglomerate on grain boundaries (GBs), forming mostly nanoscaled clusters at room temperature and more uniform segregation along GBs at 200 °C. In any case, however, the equilibrium Al3Mg2 phase does not nucleate. Using post-deformation annealing treatments, it was found that it can proceed only through a very specific orientation relationship with the face-centered-cubic Al matrix. Both the contribution of dislocations and deformation-induced vacancies were considered to account for the enhanced mobility of Mg atoms. From theoretical estimations it is, however, concluded that Mg atoms are dragged by the vacancy flux toward GBs while dislocations should not play a significant role. These data provide new insights about mechanisms controlling dynamic precipitation and segregation during SPD of aluminum alloys. The segregation and formation of clusters that is revealed can additionally contribute to the strengthening of these alloys, leading to a new understanding of dynamic ageing in non-age-hardenable alloys.},

The results in the case of a constant external stress show that the bow-out distance of the dislocation has an exponential relation with time, which can be well described by an exponential creep function with a Gaussian distribution in τ. With the increasing strain amplitude, the relaxation strength Δ and relaxation time τ decrease, while the distribution parameter increases.

The second idea is that a single physical aging mechanism, cross-core diffusion within a dislocation core, controls the aging of both the solute and forest strengthening mechanisms. All the material parameters in the model, apart from forest dislocation density evolution parameters, are derivable from atomistic-scale studies so that the theory contains essentially no adjustable parameters. The model predicts the steady-state stress/strain/strain-rate/temperature/concentration dependent material response for a variety of Al–Mg alloys, including negative strain-rate sensitivity, in qualitative and quantitative agreement with available experiments. The model also reveals the origin of non-additivity of solute and forest strengthening, and explains observed non-standard transient stress behavior in strain-rate jump tests.},

GPII zones are observed after aging at 438 K for 8 h, whereas higher aging temperatures, 463 K for 8 h and 533 K for 4 h, reveal only θ′ precipitates. Most GPII zones and θ′ precipitates are demonstrated to be Cu-deficient at the lower two aging temperatures; only the 533 K treatment resulted in θ′ stoichiometries consistent with the expected Al2Cu equilibrium composition. For alloys containing ∼200 at. ppm Si we find evidence of Si partitioning to GPII zones and θ′ precipitates. Significant Si segregation is observed at the coherent α-Al/θ′ interface for aging at 533 K, resulting in an interfacial Si concentration more than 11 times greater than in the α-Al matrix. Importantly, the Si interfacial concentration undergoes a transition from a non-equilibrium delocalized profile to an equilibrium localized profile as the aging temperature is increased from 463 to 533 K. Consistent with these measurements, first-principles calculations predict a strong thermodynamic driving force favoring Si partitioning to Cu sites in θ′. Silicon segregation at, and partitioning to, θ′ precipitates results in a decrease in interfacial free energy, and concomitantly an increase in the nucleation current. Our results suggest that Si catalyzes the early stages of precipitation in these alloys, consistent with the higher precipitate number densities observed in commercial Al–Cu–Si alloys.},

As in pure aluminum,quenching stresses determine whether Frank or perfect loops are formed in the alloy. Magnesium has little effect on the climb rate of loops, the activation energy being in the range 1.2–1.28 eV, which is similar to the values obtained by identical experiments on pure aluminum. It is concluded that the vacancy‐magnesium‐atom binding energy is extremely small. The stacking‐fault energies were estimated by comparing the rates of climb of large Frank and perfect loops in the same area of the foil so as to minimize the errors that arise if only the climb of Frank loops is measured.

	abstract = {Clustering of Mg in Al–Mg binary alloys is studied by means of atomistic simulations. The phenomenon is analysed in the undistorted Al lattice, as well as in the presence of dislocations. In the undistorted lattice, Mg has a tendency to cluster in a coherent phase. The binding energy of this structure is rather low and it dissolves at room temperature, and only dynamic associations of doublets or triples of solute atoms are observed. Increasing the temperature above 100°C inhibits the formation of any solute short range order. The application of a homogeneous hydrostatic strain has no effect on clustering. In the presence of dislocations and at room temperature, Mg clusters at cores forming the coherent phase observed in the undistorted lattice at low temperatures. Clustering at the cores of all types of dislocations is discussed. It is shown that the size, shape and structure of the cluster cannot be predicted using elementary calculations based on the pressure field generated by the unclustered dislocation. Furthermore, the field of the clustered dislocation is observed to differ from that of the unclustered defect, even at distances as large as 20 Burgers vectors from the core. The variation of the stacking fault due to clustering is determined by simply monitoring the distance between partials, which is observed to decrease upon clustering.},

In an effort to understand the physical processes occurring during natural aging, a phenomenological model was developed for the first two stages and is shown to describe the experimental observations well.

If each diffusing atom has at least several opportunities to make rapid excursions along various dislocation cores, Hart has shown that DT/DT 0 = 1+fDP /DT 0. DT is the average bulk diffusivity, DT 0 is the diffusivity in the dislocation‐free lattice, f is the fraction of atoms in dislocation pipes, and DP is the diffusivity along dislocation pipes. Under these conditions, the diffusion‐penetration is increased by the short‐circuiting but the general shape of the penetration curve is unaffected. When the dislocations are static, each diffusing atom must visit a number of dislocations, and a necessary condition for the Hart relation to hold is 2(DT 0 t)½\&gt;ld , where t is the diffusion time, and ld is the dislocation spacing.

In certain cases, this type of short‐circuiting can produce very large relative enhancements. A parallel development is given for short‐circuiting due to grain boundaries. In particular, it is shown that grain boundary migration and recrystallization, which occurs repeatedly during deformation of metals with low stacking fault energy, can, for temperatures equal to or less than about half the melting temperature, lead to a greatly increased diffusion coefficient without altering the general shape of the penetration curve.

	abstract = {A critical interpretation of recent experimental results on the effects of plastic deformation on diffusion is carried out with the aid of the results established in the preceding Parts I and II. Attention is focused on experiments carried out at elevated temperatures (higher than half the absolute melting temperature) in which diffusion occurred over macroscopic distances. The results are discussed in terms of the following possible causes of apparent enhanced diffusion: (1) generation and migration of excess point defects during deformation; (2) short‐circuiting along static or moving dislocations or grain boundaries created in the deformation; (3) short‐circuiting along cracks created in the deformation; and (4) experimental difficulties associated with interface roughness. Causes (3) and (4) are of little basic interest but must be considered in any survey of experimental results. Fourteen experiments in all are considered. Ten of these experiments showed no apparent enhancements within the expected experimental error of about 50\% in the diffusivity. In one of these ten experiments a large enhancement was reported, but is is shown that this was due solely to an error in mathematical analysis. Two of the experiments showed large apparent enhancements, and it is shown that they were almost certainly due to (4). One of the experiments showed apparent enhancements due to (3) but showed no enhancement in the absence of cracking. One of the experiments showed enhancements which, it is concluded, are not inconsistent with present knowledge of (2). [Very recent work by Brown and Blackburn (unpublished) indicate that at least some of the enhancements in this experiment may have been due to (4)]. It is generally concluded that in no case has a diffusion enhancement been detected due to the generation of excess vacancies. However, enhancement in one case may have occurred as a result of short‐circuiting. These results are consistent with other high temperature deformation phenomena, e.g., creep kinetics, and are also consistent with the point defect and short‐circuiting models developed in the preceding Parts I and II which predict very small effects due to point defects and possibly larger effects in certain cases due to short‐circuiting.},

Here, we report a large database of solute–vacancy binding energies determined from first-principles density functional calculations. The calculated binding energies agree well with accurate measurements where available, and provide an accurate predictor of solute–vacancy binding in other systems. We find: (i) some common solutes in commercial Al alloys (e.g., Cu and Mg) possess either very weak (Cu), or even repulsive (Mg), binding energies. Hence, we assert that some previously reported large binding energies for these solutes are erroneous. (ii) Large binding energies are found for Sn, Cd and In, confirming the proposed mechanism for the reduced natural aging in Al–Cu alloys containing microalloying additions of these solutes. (iii) In addition, we predict that similar reduction in natural aging should occur with additions of Si, Ge and Au. (iv) Even larger binding energies are found for other solutes (e.g., Pb, Bi, Sr, Ba), but these solutes possess essentially no solubility in Al. (v) We have explored the physical effects controlling solute–vacancy binding in Al. We find that there is a strong correlation between binding energy and solute size, with larger solute atoms possessing a stronger binding with vacancies. (vi) Most transition-metal 3d solutes do not bind strongly with vacancies, and some are even energetically strongly repelled from vacancies, particularly for the early 3d solutes, Ti and V.},

	abstract = {Rapid diffusion along dislocation cores generally enhances the average bulk diffusion in a dislocated crystal. If each diffusing atom has at least several opportunities to make rapid excursions along various dislocation cores, Hart has shown that DT/DT 0 = 1+fDP /DT 0. DT is the average bulk diffusivity, DT 0 is the diffusivity in the dislocation‐free lattice, f is the fraction of atoms in dislocation pipes, and DP is the diffusivity along dislocation pipes. Under these conditions, the diffusion‐penetration is increased by the short‐circuiting but the general shape of the penetration curve is unaffected. When the dislocations are static, each diffusing atom must visit a number of dislocations, and a necessary condition for the Hart relation to hold is 2(DT 0 t)½\&gt;ld , where t is the diffusion time, and ld is the dislocation spacing. When this condition fails (for example, at lower temperatures), and when the dislocations are static, it is demonstrated that the amount of short‐circuiting is greatly reduced and that the dislocations become essentially ``clogged.\&apos;\&apos; However, if the dislocations move through the crystal, as they do in plastic deformation, the situation is quite different, since in this case the dislocations may visit the diffusing atoms rather than vice versa. In such cases, the short‐circuiting may again be randomized and the enhancement can be as large as (but no larger than) the result given by Hart, even if 2(DT 0 t)½\&lt;ld . In certain cases, this type of short‐circuiting can produce very large relative enhancements. A parallel development is given for short‐circuiting due to grain boundaries. In particular, it is shown that grain boundary migration and recrystallization, which occurs repeatedly during deformation of metals with low stacking fault energy, can, for temperatures equal to or less than about half the melting temperature, lead to a greatly increased diffusion coefficient without altering the general shape of the penetration curve. A number of the results established in this work (Part II) are used in Part III (to be published) where a comprehensive interpretation of recent experimental work in the field is carried out. Part I consists of an analysis of point defect models for strain‐enhanced diffusion.},

	abstract = {The influence of deformation-induced excess vacancies on segregation and on precipitation is discussed within a phenomenological framework. During high temperature deformation, vacancies are mainly generated by the non-conservative movement of thermal jogs. Sinks for these vacancies are dislocations and grain boundaries. The excess vacancy concentration increases with strain rate and inverse temperature. Stronger effects are expected in f.c.c. materials because of their comparatively low diffusivities; in austenitic steels, the concentrations of deformation-induced vacancies are predicted to be significant, even at temperatures as high as 0.75 of the melting temperature. At the high strain rates ({\textgreater} 10 s−1) used in industrial rolling, the vacancy concentration may attain levels 2–3 orders-of-magnitude higher than the equilibrium one. One consequence of the presence of deformation-induced vacancies is the non-equilibrium segregation of boron observed e.g. in austenitic Nb-B steels, where it stimulates the nucleation of Nb borocarbonitrides.
L'influence de lacunes en excès induites par déformation sur la ségrégation et sur la précipitation est analysée dans la cadre d'une modèle phénoménologique. Lors de la déformation à haute température les lacunes sont surtout formées par le mouvement non conservatif de sauts de dislocation thermiques. L'annihilation de ces lacunes se produit au niveau des dislocations et joints de grain. La concentration de lacunes en excès augmente avec la vitesse de déformation et l'inverse de la temperature. Les effets sont plus importants dans les matériaux c.f.c., dû à leur taux de diffusion relativement faible. Dans les aciers austénitiques, des concentrations significatives de lacunes induites par déformation sont prédites, même à des températures aussi élevées que 0.75 du point de fusion. Pour les vitesses de déformation importantes utilisées dans les procédés industriels de laminage, la concentration en lacunes peut atteindre des ordres de grandeur de 2 à 3 fois plus élevés que ceux enregistrés à l'équilibre. Une conséquence de la formation de lacunes induite par déformation est la ségrégation hors équilibre de bore, observée par exemple dans les aciers austénitiques Nb-B, dans lesquels elle stimule la précipitation de Nb-borocarbonitrides.
Der Einflub verformungsinduzierter Überschubleerstellen auf das Segregationsund Ausscheidungsverhalten wird im Rahmen eines phänomenologischen Modells diskutiert. Während Warmverformung werden Leerstellen hauptsächlich durch die nichtkonservative Bewegung von thermischen Versetzungssprüngen erzeugt. Senken für diese Leerstellen sind Versetzungen und Korngrenzen. Die Konsentration der Überschubleerstellen steigt mit Verformungsgeschwindigkeit und inverser Temperatur an. Wegen der relativ geringen Diffusionstaten werden stärkere Effekte in k.f.z.-Materialien erwartet. Für austenitische Stähle wird abgeschätzt, dab die Konzentration verformungsinduzierter Leerstellen selbst noch bei Temperaturen von 0, 75 der Schmelztemperatur erheblich ist. Für hohe Verformungsgeschwindigkeiten ({\textgreater} 10 s−1), wie sie in industriellen Walzprozessen auftreten, kann die Leerstellenkonzentration zwei bis drei Gröbenordnungen über dem Gleichgewichtswert liegen. Eine Folge der Existenz verformungsinduzierter Leerstellen ist die Nichtgleichgewichtssegregation von Bor, die z.B. in austenitischen Nb-B-Stählen beobachtet wird, wo sie die Keimblildung von Nb-Borokarbonitriden beschleunigt.},

This approach gives a satisfactory quantitative description of the effect of grain size on the yield stress. The strengthening of as-quenched Al is also discussed.

Der Einfluβ von Korngröβe und Dehnung auf die Verfestigung des abgeschreckten und ausgelagerten Aluminiums wurde anhand der Wechselwirkung zwischen Leerstellen und Korngrenzen analysiert.

Experimental procedures developed by Michio Kiritani and colleagues have been applied to quantify defect cluster size, density, and nature. Differences in defect accumulation behavior of irradiated BCC and FCC metals are discussed. Depending on the defect cluster obstacle strength, either the dispersed barrier hardening model or the Friedel–Kroupa–Hirsch weak barrier model can be used to describe major aspects of radiation hardening. Irradiation at low temperature can cause a change in deformation mode from dislocation cell formation at low doses to twinning or dislocation channeling at higher doses. The detailed interaction between dislocations and defect clusters helps determine the dominant deformation mode. Recent observations of the microstructure created by plastic deformation of quenched and irradiated metals are summarized, including in situ deformation results. Examples of annihilation of stacking fault tetrahedra by gliding dislocations and subsequent formation of mobile superjogs are shown.},

Pre-existing clusters are solute structures that exist in the specimen before deformation. During deformation, additional solute concentration fluctuation takes place as solute diffuses towards dislocations, which themselves form an evolving population. Cluster growth takes place at the same rate with cluster dissolution, which produces residual clusters, i.e. solute clusters that are not located on a dislocation at given time and are dissolving slowly. A conceptual model is used to study the effect of both types of solute structures on the strain rate sensitivity. The model predicts that residual clusters lead to the shrinkage of the negative rate sensitivity domain in the temperature-rate plane, the effect being more pronounced in the region corresponding to low temperatures/high rates. The effect of pre-existing clusters is to shift the domain to lower temperatures and/or higher rates. This is in agreement with recent experimental observations made on Al–Mg alloys.},

	abstract = {The nucleation and growth of S' precipitates in an aluminium-2.5\% copper-1.2\% magnesium alloy aged at 190°C have been examined by transmission electron microscopy. The S' precipitates have been shown to be heterogeneously nucleated at dislocations, and to grow as laths on \{210\} planes in a 〈001〉 direction. The shape of the laths is consistent with the degree of mismatch of the matrix and precipitate planes at the precipitate-matrix interfaces. Precipitate sheets are formed at dislocations by the growth of these laths on \{210\} planes with a common 〈001〉 growth direction; the growth planes conform to the strain energy requirement that the misfit vector of the precipitate should lie approximately parallel to the Burgers vector of the dislocation, and are those expected from consideration of the effect of the line tension of the dislocation. The possibility of refining the precipitate distribution is discussed, and an increase in the density of sites for heterogeneous nucleation (e.g. by prestrain prior to ageing) or a modification of the interfacial energy (e.g. by addition of silicon) are both shown to result in refinement of the S' precipitate distribution.
La germination et la croissance des précipités S' dans un alliage d'aluminium contenant 2,5\% Cu et 1,2\% Mg vieilli à 190°C ont été étudiées au moyen de lames minces en microscopie électronique. La germination des précipités S' se fait de façon hétérogène, aux dislocations, et ces précipités croissent en prenant la forme de lattes sur les plans \{210\} et suivant une direction 0̌01〉. La forme de ces lattes est fonction du degré de désorientation de la matrice et du plan du précipité à l'interface précipité-matrice. Des palquettes de précipités se forment aux dislocations par croissance des lattes suivant les plans \{210\} et avec une direction de croissance 〈001〉 commune. En accord avec les données d'énergie de déformation, les plans de croissance sont tels que le vecteur de désorientation du précipité soit approximativement parallèle au vecteur de Burgers de la dislocation; des considérations sur les effects de tension de ligne des dislocations permettaient de prévoir ces faits. Les auteurs discutent ensuite de la possibilité d'affiner la distribution du précipité. Un tel effet est produit soit par un accroissement de la densité des sites de germination hétérogène (par exemple par vieillissement après une prédéformation) soit par une modification de l'énergie de l'interface (par exemple au moyen de l'addition de silicium).
Mit Hilfe des Elektronenmikroskops wurden Keimbildung und Wachstum von S'-Ausscheidungen in einer Aluminium-2.5\% Kupfer-1.2\% Magnesium-Legierung nach Alterung bei 190°C untersucht. Es wurde gezeigt, daβ die S'-Ausscheidungen durch heterogene Keimbildung an Versetzungen entstehen. Sie wachsen in Form von Nadeln in der \{210\}-Ebene in 〈001〉-Richtung. Die Gestalt dieser Nadeln ist konsistent mit dem Maβ der Fehlorientierung von Matrix und Ausscheidungsebenen an den Zwischenflächen. Plättchen von Ausscheidungen werden an Versetzungen durch Wachsen dieser Nadeln auf \{210\}-Ebenen mit einer gemeinsamen Wachstumsrichtung 〈001〉 gebildet.

Es sind genau diejenigen, welche man auf Grund einer Betrachtung des Einflusses der Linienspannung auf die Versetzung erwartet. Es wird die Möglichkeit einer Verfeinerung der Ausscheidungsverteilung diskutiert. Es wird gezeigt, daβ sowohl eine Zunahme der Dichte der Orte für heterogene Keimbildung (z.B. durch Vorverformung vor der Alterung) als auch eine Änderung der Zweischenflächenenergie (z.B. durch Zusatz von Silizium) zu einer Verfeinerung der Verteilung der S'-Ausscheidungen führt.},

	abstract = {The kinetics of clustering of solute in the aluminum rich alloys Al(Cu), Al(Ag) and Al(Zn) was investigated by means of resistivity measurements. In each of the alloys there is, after a rapid quench from the homogenization temperature, a fast initial clustering at temperatures 200°–300°K. This reaction proceeds with an activation energy 0.5–0.6 eV in Al(Cu) and Al(Ag) alloys, and 0.4 eV in Al(Zn) alloys. In Al(Cu) and Al(Ag) alloys the isothermal progress of the reaction is, to a first approximation, independent of solute concentration.
The forms of the isotherms are interpreted on the hypothesis that from the atomically dispersed state the reaction corresponds to the surface energy driven growth of large clusters at the expense of smaller ones. The growth rate, the total progress of the reaction, and their marked variation with thermal history, are satisfactorily interpreted with the quenched-in vacancy hypothesis if it is supposed, in addition, that sensible nucleation of dislocation loops occurs at very high vacancy supersaturations. We present evidence that the limiting cluster size is dictated by kinetic rather than by thermodynamic factors.
We have found that in very dilute Al(Ag) alloys the isothermal resistivity [as in the case of Al(Zn) and Al(Cu)] rises with time in the earliest stages of clustering.
After the rapid initial clustering there is a further slow reaction in Al(Cu) alloys which occurs over a period of several weeks. This rate is still much greater than that calculated from the extrapolated values of the high temperature diffusion constant of Cu in Al. Some possible interpretations of this slow reaction are outlined.
La cinétique de ségrégation du soluté dans les alliages AlCu, AlAg et AlZn riches en aluminium a été étudiée au moyen de mesures de résistivité électrique. Dans chacun de ces alliages et après trempe rapide à partir de la température d'homogénéisation, une ségrégation rapide se manifeste d'abord à des températures comprises entre 200 et 300°K. Cette réaction met en jeu une énergie d'activation de 0.5 à 0.6 eV pour AlCu et AlAg et de 0.4 eV pour AlZn.
Dans les alliages AlCu et AlAg, l'évolution isotherme de la réaction est en première approximation indépendante de la concentration du soluté. La forme des isothermes est interprétée avec l'hypothèse d'après laquelle la réaction correspond à la croissance (due à l'énergie de surface) de gros amas au détriment d'autres plus petits. La vitesse de croissance le progrès total de la réaction et leur variation avec l'histoire thermique sont interprétées de façon satisfaisante à partir de l'hypothèse de trempe des lacunes et si on suppose en plus qu'une nucléation importante d'anneaux de dislocations apparaît pour de hautes concentrations en lacunes.
Les auteurs montrent que la taille limite des amas est déterminée par les facteurs cinétiques plutôt que thermodynamiques.
Les auteurs ont trouvé que dans les alliages très dilués AlAg, la résistivité isotherme (comme dans le cas de AlZn et AlCu) augmente au cours du temps dans les stades initiaux de la ségrégation.
Après la ségrégation initiale rapide, il y a ensuite une réaction lente dans les alliages AlCu qui se déroule sur une période de plusieurs semaines.
Cette itesse est encore beaucoup plus élevée que celle calculée à partir des valeurs extrapolées à haute température des constantes de diffusion de Cu dans Al. Quelques interprétations possibles de cette réaction lente sont envisagées.
Mit Hilfe von Widerstandsmessungen wurde die Kinetik der Entmischung des Zusatzes bei den Aluminium-reichen Legierungen Al(Cu), Al(Ag) und Al(Zn) untersucht. Nach schnellem Abschrecken von der Homogenisierungstemperatur tritt bei jeder dieser Legierungen eine anfängliche schnelle Entmischung bei Temperaturen von 200°–300°K auf. Diese Reaktion läuft ab mit einer Aktivierungsenergie von 0.5–0.6 eV bei Al(Cu)-und Al(Ag)-Legierungen und 0.4 eV bei Al(Zn)-Legierungen. Bei Al(Cu)- und Al(Ag)-Legierungen hängt der isotherme Ablauf der Reaktion in erster Näherung nicht von der Konzentration des Zusatzes ab.
Die Isothermen werden auf Grund der Hypothese interpretiert, daß die Reaktion dem durch die Oberflächenenergie verursachten Wachstum großer Agglomerate auf Kosten kleiner entspricht, und zwar beginnend vom Zustand atomarer Dispersion. Die Wachstumsgeschwindigkeit, der allgemeine Fortgang der Reaktion und die ausgesprochene Abhängigkeit von der vorhergegangenen Warmebehandlung lassen sich durch die Hypothese eingefrorener Leerstellen zufriedenstellend erklären, wenn man zusätzlich annimmt, daß bei sehr hohen Überschußkonzentrationen von Leerstellen merkliche Bildung von Versetzungsschleifen eintritt. Wir bringen Beweise dafür, daß die Größe der Agglomerate durch kinetische und nicht durch thermodynamische Faktoren begrenzt wird.
In sehr verdünnten Al(Ag)-Legierungen steigt [wie bei Al(Zn) und Al(Cu)] der isotherme Widerstand in den ersten Stadien der Entmischung.
Nach der anfänglichen schnellen Zusammenlagerung tritt bei Al(Cu)-Legierungen eine weitere langsame Reaktion auf, die sich über einige Wochen erstreckt. Diese Reaktionsgeschwindigkeit ist immer noch viel größer, als man sie mit extrapolierten Werten der Diffusionskonstanten von Cu in Al bei hohen Temperaturen berechnet. Einige Erklärungsmöglichkeiten dieser langsamen Reaktion werden angegeben.},

Although the rapid hardening reaction occurs within 1 min at 150 degrees C, no evidence for solute clusters or Guinier-Preston-Bagaryatsky (GPB) zones was detected using the 3DAP after this ageing time. When a short-term aged specimen is deformed and then aged at 150 degrees C, further rapid hardening occurs. This suggests that the rapid hardening is associated with a solutedislocation interaction. Uniform dispersions of Cu-Mg co-clusters do not occur until closer to the end of the hardness plateau and it is thought that these evolve into GPB zones during the second stage of the age-hardening process.},

	abstract = {Critical strain to serrated flow in solid solution alloys exhibiting dynamic strain aging (DSA) or Portevin-LeChatelier effect is due to the strain-induced vacancy production. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques can be used to monitor in situ the dynamical behavior of point and line defects in materials during deformation, and these techniques are nondestructive and noninvasive. The new CUT-sequence pulse method allowed an accurate evaluation of the strain-enhanced vacancy diffusion and, thus, the excess vacancy concentration during deformation as a function of strain, strain rate, and temperature. Due to skin effect problems in metals at high frequencies, thin foils of Al were used and experimental results correlated with models based on vacancy production through mechanical work (vs thermal jogs), while in situ annealing of excess vacancies is noted at high temperatures. These correlations made it feasible to obtain explicit dependencies of the strain-induced vacancy concentration on test variables such as the strain, strain rate, and temperature. These studies clearly reveal the power and utility of these NMR techniques in the determination of deformation-induced vacancies in situ in a noninvasive fashion.},
